    "\n",
    "These instructions guide you through creating a structured JSON object to analyze media coverage of protests by categorizing quotes, slogans, chants, and statements from relevant articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify and Extract Content:** \n",
    "   - Carefully read the article, identifying the protest goals and all direct quotes, slogans, chants, and statements.\n",
    "   - Extract the exact wording used in the article, ensuring accurate capture of each quote, slogan, chant, or statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine Source and Role:**\n",
    "   - Identify who said or wrote each piece of content. This could be an individual, group, or entity.\n",
    "   - Classify their role(s) as:\n",
    "     - **Protester:** Actively involved or speaking during the protest.\n",
    "     - **Bystander:** Observer neither directly involved nor targeted.\n",
    "     - **Target:** Person, group, or institution that the protest is directed against or seeking to influence.\n",
    "     - **Law Enforcement:** Police, military, or other authorities responding to the protest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classify Content Type:**\n",
    "   - Categorize each piece as:\n",
    "     - **Quote:** Direct statement made by an individual or group.\n",
    "     - **Statement:** Formal declaration or assertion, often in a press release.\n",
    "     - **Slogan:** Short, memorable phrase used by protesters, often on banners or signs.\n",
    "     - **Chant:** Rhythmic phrase repeated by a crowd during a protest.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine Alignment with Protest Goals:**\n",
    "   - Assess the alignment of the content with the protest's objectives:\n",
    "     - **Aligned:** Supports or aligns with the protest's objectives.\n",
    "     - **Opposed:** Against the protest's objectives.\n",
    "     - **Neutral:** Neither clearly for nor against the protest's objectives.\n",
    "   - Focus on the speaker's position relative to the protest's aims, rather than the tone of their statement.\n",
    "   - Remember: When determining the alignment, focus on how the content relates to the protest's objectives, not the tone or sentiment of the statement itself. This approach helps avoid confusion when protesters speak negatively about their targets while still supporting the overall protest goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create and Populate the JSON Structure:**\n",
    "   - Create a JSON object with an array called \"protestContent\"\n",
    "   - For each piece of content, create an object with the following properties:\n",
    "     1. **content:** Exact wording of the quote, slogan, chant, or statement.\n",
    "     2. **source:** Individual, group, or entity that made the statement or created the slogan/chant.\n",
    "     3. **description:** Brief description of who the person or group is, including their role or title.\n",
    "     4. **role:** Protester, bystander, target, or law enforcement.\n",
    "     5. **type:** Quote, statement, slogan, or chant.\n",
    "     6. **alignment:** Aligned, opposed, or neutral (with respect to protest goals).\n",
    "   - Add each object to the \"protestContent\" array.\n",
    "   - Ensure accuracy and completeness of the information.\n",
    "   - Double-check for any errors or omissions, verifying that content matches the source material and classifications are correct.\n",

    "Climate Activists Clash with Authorities in Latest Protest\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dramatic display of civil disobedience, members of the climate activist group Last Generation took to the streets today, brandishing signs with the slogan \"Oil kills.\" The protest, aimed at drawing attention to the environmental impact of fossil fuels, quickly drew a sharp rebuke from government officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interior Minister of Germany, Nancy Faeser, did not mince words in her condemnation of the activists' tactics. \"These criminal actions are dangerous and stupid,\" Faeser stated. \"These anarchists are risking not only their own lives, but are also endangering others.\" The minister's strong words underscore the growing tension between climate activists and law enforcement agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all reactions were as pointed. The city mayor, attempting to strike a balance between acknowledging the protesters' message and maintaining public order, offered a more measured response. \"While we understand the protesters' concerns, we must ensure the safety of all citizens,\" the local government official said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contrasting reactions highlight the complex dynamics at play in the ongoing debate over climate change and environmental policy. As activists continue to push for immediate action on climate issues, authorities grapple with the challenge of balancing the right to protest with public safety concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protest by Last Generation is just the latest in a series of high-profile demonstrations by climate activists worldwide. As the global community continues to wrestle with the urgent need for climate action, it's clear that the debate over how best to address these concerns is far from over.\n",

    "Hundreds of workers flooded the city center today, their voices echoing off buildings as they chanted \"Fair pay now!\" The protest, organized by the United Workers Union, brought traffic to a standstill as demonstrators demanded higher wages in the face of rising living costs.\n",
    "Jane Doe, a factory worker participating in the protest, expressed the frustration felt by many of her colleagues. \"We're not asking for much, just a living wage,\" she said. \"How can they expect us to survive on these salaries?\"\n",
    "The demonstration has reignited the debate over fair compensation, with business groups warning of potential economic consequences. The Chamber of Commerce, representing local businesses, cautioned against hasty decisions. \"The proposed wage increase would bankrupt small businesses and lead to job losses,\" the organization stated in a press release.\n",
    "As the protest unfolded, law enforcement maintained a visible presence. The Police Chief emphasized the delicate balance they must strike: \"The right to protest is fundamental, but we must also maintain public order and ensure access to public spaces.\"\n",
    "The demonstration's impact extended beyond those directly involved. John Smith, a local commuter caught in the protest-induced traffic, expressed mixed feelings. \"I support better wages, but blocking traffic isn't the way to do it. I'm late for work now,\" he said, highlighting the complex reactions among the general public.\n",
    "This latest protest underscores the ongoing tension between workers' rights advocates and business interests. As both sides dig in their heels, the path to resolution remains unclear. The city waits to see how local officials and business leaders will respond to the workers' demands, and whether a compromise can be reached to address the concerns of all parties involved.\n",
    "The United Workers Union has vowed to continue their campaign until their demands are met, suggesting that today's demonstration may be just the beginning of a prolonged struggle for fair pay.\n",

    "Audrey Kauffman speaks while Rep. Mark Rozzi, D-Berks, holds a photo board of Kauffman's children during a rally Monday at the state Capitol. Kauffman, whose ex-husband was sentenced for abusing three of their children, spoke in support of opening a civil window for lawsuits against abusers and enabling organizations like religious groups.\n",

    " Abuse survivors from plain communities rally to open legal window in Pa. for civil justice\n",
    "Mary Byler tells her story of abuse and calls for Pennsylvania lawmakers to act on pending legislation that advocates say would bring justice for long-ago survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Byler was among those who rallied Monday outside the state Capitol.\n",

    "   \n",
    "HARRISBURG — The pain suffered by survivors of childhood sexual abuse seemed tangible Monday outside the state Capitol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survivors spoke of the hurt they experienced at the hands of their attackers within plain religious communities including Amish, Anabaptist and Mennonite, and from harassment endured when they spoke out and sought justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "They rallied for the Republican-controlled state Senate to adopt legislation toward opening a two-year window allowing civil lawsuits against alleged perpetrators and enablers in cases where the statute of limitations expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If we have a chance to make a predator’s identity known, we should take it. I am not sure what humane argument can be made against this. Also, the institutions that cover up abuse, they must be held accountable,” said Misty Griffin, whose memoir “Tears of the Silenced” was developed into the Peacock documentary “Sins of the Amish.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Audrey Kauffman demanded the crowd gathered outside the Capitol look at family photos of her children. Her ex-husband, Michael Kauffman, was sentenced in November 2021 to serve five to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing their three daughters. The abuse occurred while they belonged to an Amish subgroup in Cumberland County.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kauffman said she was an abuse and rape survivor, too, and was diligent in adopting safeguards to protect her own children. She didn’t suspect a predator under their roof. When she reported the allegations years after leaving her Amish community, she said some members harassed her for bringing the case public.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When you sit beside your children’s beds after suicide attempts, through nightmares, eating disorders, depression, and you walk your children through survival to healing, you can’t make that up,” Kauffman said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Byler scanned the crowd from beneath a wide-brimmed black hat. She was among several “Sins” cast members who rallied in support of pending legislation. Byler, who was raised in western Pennsylvania, accused an Amish church deacon of abusing her across eight years. She also said she learned her father, who died when she was 5, had confessed to sexually abusing her as a child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her words caked in anger and sadness, Byler stood resolute in demanding an avenue for recourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is not Amish culture that is utopian, that is exempt from childhood sexual abuse. There is no exception. Not one,” Byler said. “Even if I will never have justice I choose justice for the ones who come after me because it is still happening today in our homes, in our churches, in our schools, in every organization. If our senators won’t pass this it shows how unwilling they are to protect our children and, if so, get rid of them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the dogged advocacy of victims’ rights organizations and lawmakers like Rep. Mark Rozzi, D-Berks, an abuse survivor, the state House already advanced three bills that would open the two-year window — two proposed constitutional amendments and a proposed statute. Aside from a passing vote in the Senate, the proposed amendments would also need voter approval at the ballot boxes. Should an amendment proposal be passed before August, voters would see the ballot question in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the Senate did already advance one amendment proposal. And, it did so in January, having opened the possibility of a May ballot referendum that ultimately didn’t materialize. That’s because the proposal came as a package coupled with separate proposals on enacting universal voter ID and empowering the Legislature to overturn state agency regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those additional measures, opposed by Democrats, were stripped from the bill in the House before being returned to the Senate for concurrence on the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kate Eckhart Flessner, spokeswoman for the Senate Republican Caucus, reiterated a message that leaders from the upper chamber have held to: That they’re “unwavering” in their position to advance only its package of amendment proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While the House decided to remove two of the three measures from Senate Bill 1 as it was passed by the Senate, our Caucus remains open to conversations about how to accomplish all three of the important constitutional amendments initially included in SB 1,” Flessner said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marci Hamilton, founder and CEO of CHILD USA, an interdisciplinary think tank focused on children’s civil rights, spoke of the 18 years and counting that she, Rozzi and many others have worked to temporarily lift the civil statute of limitations. In that time, she said 26 states revived expired statutes to allow civil lawsuits — some opening a window permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "State Rep. Maureen Madden, D-Monroe, said that in New York there are 7,000 cases pending for victims of long-ago abuse. She said the legislative remedy is proven to deter abuse and coverups. And, like Rozzi and others including Rep. Jim Gregory, R-Blair/Huntingdon, and Rep. La’Tasha Mayes, D-Allegheny, Madden revealed that she, too, is an abuse survivor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Madden spoke of decades-old repressed memories dating to when she was just 5 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Without warning they come flooding back and I recall in vivid detail from so long ago that my heart and brain will never let me forget,” Madden said.'''"
