## 'Never been more urgent': Service providers rally lawmakers for sexual violence prevention

Leer en Español Read in English

Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — Charlee Barker didn't realize she was in an abusive relationship at the time, but she discovered her high school relationship wasn't what it had seemed when a stressful situation later "triggered" the realization of the "bad situation" she had been in.

Now a college student, Barker joined with several domestic violence and rape recovery organizations to rally at the Capitol in Salt Lake City Wednesday, sharing her story to urge lawmakers to approve a $3.25 million appropriation for sexual violence prevention.

Barker said she has come to learn that "each one of us are a product of our environment," telling KSL.com that her high school boyfriend didn't have role models of a healthy, loving relationship at home.

"I come from a home where I had great relationships and I definitely had a great example, and still there was a lack of, 'Oh, this isn't OK,'" Barker said of her relationship. "I definitely think it should be talked about in every environment because you just never know what conversation is actually going to spark change."

Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, said he's pushing for the appropriation to prevent sexual assault, which he described as an attempt to "expand the toolbox" of local providers and parents, making sure "we're going upstream and not just spending lots of money downstream with the response." That money will help local service providers educate people on what goes into a healthy relationship, among other things.

House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City — who has proposed a litany of bills to protect survivors of sexual assault during her time in the Legislature — said it was "so refreshing and so nice to have colleagues on the other side of the aisle" who want to address the issue.

She noted that Utah has a higher rate of rape compared to the national average and urged other lawmakers to take steps to address the problem before it happens, rather tha...

## Hundreds attend vigil for Israel in Poughkeepsie

POUGHKEEPSIE – The Jewish Federation of Dutchess County held a “Community Solidarity Vigil” Thursday evening in response to the Hamas attack on Israel that has escalated into war. Hamas soldiers broke through Israel’s famed defense systems on October 7, 2023, and began attacking civilians and kidnapping others.

The Hamas assault was denounced by countries around the globe. In Poughkeepsie, the Jewish Federation of Dutchess County partnered with several Jewish organizations in holding a vigil at the Temple Beth-El in Poughkeepsie. More than 400 people, from all faiths, joined religious and elected leaders in calling for peace in Gaza. The City of Poughkeepsie Police Department and representatives of the New York State Police sent uniformed officers to provide safety during the vigil. No direct threats had been received and the officers were present to provide an added level of safety and security, according to City of Poughkeepsie Police Captain Rich Wilson.

Hamas militants attacked Israel at Dan on October 7, firing more than 6,000 rockets into Israel. Rockets, supplemented by Hamas soldiers have killed more than 1,500 Israelis, wounded more than 3,000, and kidnapped approximately 150 Israeli civilians and soldiers.

the Federation’s Executive Director, Karen Hochhauser told Mid-Hudson News that the unprovoked attacks are “absolutely shocking and horrific.” Noting that Israel is the same size as the state of New Jersey, she put things in perspective. “Imagine 6,000 rockets being dumped on the state of New Jersey.” Comparing the 3,300 injured Jews and 1,300 murdered Israelis to the population of the United States, Hochhauser said it would be equal to 40,000 Americans being killed. “That’s 10,000 more than live here in the City of Poughkeepsie. Imagine the entire City of Poughkeepsie being wiped out.” The executive director noted that of the 150 hostages, many are children as young as six months old and one is a Holocaust survivor.

## March protests safety conditions after downtown Seattle shooting

After a pregnant woman was killed in what appears to have been a random shooting in downtown Seattle, a woman organized a march to prevent more tragedies throughout the city.

Susanna Keilman, a former U.S. Air Force Medic, went on The Jason Rantz Show on KTTH to talk about why she was motivated to organize a march in order to unite for safety and push for change in how crime is handled in western Washington.



Pregnant woman, unborn child, die in Belltown shooting

The March to Take Back the City took place Saturday at 4th Avenue and Lenora Street. It started with a moment of silence for the victim and proceeded with a march to her restaurant near Pike Place Market.

Safety isn’t political. Eina Kwon and her unborn child deserved better. Everyone who loves Seattle deserves better. #Unite4Safety pic.twitter.com/JT7nJT5g37 — Brandi Kruse (@BrandiKruse) June 17, 2023

On Tuesday morning, a man approached Eina Kwon, 34, and her husband Sung Kwon, 37, in their car, fired at the driver’s side with a handgun, and ran away, the probable cause statement said. Video from the neighborhood showed no previous interaction with the victims.

Police said they found a 30-year-old man who matched witnesses’ description soon after, and he raised his arms and said, “I did it, I did it,” according to police.

The man was taken into custody, and a judge found probable cause to hold him on investigation of homicide, assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm.

Keilman said she thinks this attack has to do with Kwon being an Asian-American woman and that, as an Asian-American woman herself, see wants to empower and unite the community.

“The Korean community and much of the AAPI has been discouraged from the whole cancel culture movement, and as a result, have been really scared and afraid to speak up against crime,” Keilman said. “…Well, you certainly can’t ignore the fact that she was a Korean-American female. When someone is intentionally injured in specific areas, there’s nothing ...

## Jewish teens voice concerns over rise of antisemitism at South Shore rally

Posted Friday, December 1, 2023 12:15 pm

Jewish teenagers from high schools and colleges came together at a rally in Merrick last week, in solidarity and support for Israel amid its ongoing war against Hamas.

In the weeks following the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas entered Israel and killed more than 1,000 people, taking hundreds captive, Jews have been affected by a steady increase in antisemitism around the world.

Students in particular have witnessed and been affected by hate in schools. Just a few weeks ago, swastikas were found in an East Meadow High School classroom — an incident that joins countless others on Long Island.

At the Nov. 22 rally, organized by Jodi Turk-Goldberg and Stephanie Arnell, in collaboration with the Chabad of Merrick-Bellmore-Wantagh, dozens of teenagers from many different communities gathered at the intersection of Broadcast Plaza and Merrick Avenue, near the Merrick Long Island Rail Road station. Rabbis, leaders in the Jewish community and elected officials joined the students, and several speakers took the stage to pledge their unwavering support for Israel.

“The reason why you’re gathered right here today is because many of us feel surrounded by the darkness in our schools, our colleges and on the streets,” Rabbi Shimon Kramer, director of the Chabad Center, said. “Your mission is to light the candle for truth and for the Jewish people.”

The rally raised $500, all of which is being donated to Heart2Heart, an organization that assists Israel Defense Forces.

The student speakers at the rally included Sofie Glassman of East Meadow High School; Hailey Arnell of Wellington C. Mepham High School; Madison Lange of John F. Kennedy High School; Liam Schorr, a student at Columbia University; and Matthew Pfeffer, a student at Brandeis University.

Ryan Kertzner, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, played a musical performance on guitar at the end of the rally.

Glassman, a junior, said that throughout her high school career, an...

## Neighbors in McCormick County to protest over not receiving mail

AUGUSTA, Ga. (WJBF) – A community in McCormick County is planning a protest. They say their mail service is about to be cut off.

Neighbors in Savannah Lakes Village – a mostly senior citizen community- might stop getting mail on February 10.

“Can you imagine?” asked Gerry Goldstein, a Savannah Lakes Village resident. “We have veterans who get their medicine from the VA, we get our tax bills, we get everything else…Can you imagine what kind of chaos it’s gonna cause people?”

Protest organizer and resident Gerry Goldstein held a previous rally in April 2022.

He tells us McCormick Postmaster Evelyn Case has yet to respond to the community’s concerns.

“I’m doing this for the rest of the community,” said Goldstein. “Because if I got mail, everybody should have mail.”

Goldstein tells us the decision to stop mail stems from a U. S. Postal Service policy change for new developments after 2012 – Savannah Lakes Village opened in 1989.

Goldstein tells me that, no matter what, they are going to keep trying.

“What we’re trying to do with the rally is bring attention to all the problems we’re having and the way we’re being mistreated,” said Goldstein. “Bullying, you know, intimidated. And basically holding us hostage for our mail. I mean, you can’t make this stuff up. And, so, if we could get some attention, the court of public opinion will work. And, by getting it out there, the higher up managers at the post office will see…let’s get this resolved, it’s not good for anybody.”

We reached out to Postmaster Evelyn Case and are waiting for a response.

The rally will be held next Thursday at noon at the McCormick County post office....

## Minnesota protesters, officials call for cease-fire in Gaza

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul on Saturday to demand a cease-fire in Palestine and Israel.

Protesters said they are urging the U.S. to take all necessary steps to stop the violence in the region. Israel cut off water, electricity and other aid from Gaza after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israel two weeks ago.

For many Minnesotans, the crisis in the Middle East hits close to home. Maple Grove residents Tariq and Manal Harmouda said close to three dozen of their relatives were killed in western Gaza on Thursday night.

Manal’s mother and one of her nephews were the only survivors. The family ran the oldest and largest eye clinic in Gaza and four family members that were killed were doctors.

Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the air strike most likely happened while the family was sleeping. Like many other families in Gaza, they all lived in the same building. Hussein said the Harmoudas last heard from their family members in Gaza on Wednesday.

“Almost all Palestinians are hoping they don’t get the call. The call that a member of their family has been killed,” Hussein said. “We’re seeing almost everyone be impacted one way or the other.”

Hussein said stories like the Harmoudas’ are catalysts for demanding a cease-fire in the region.

“Our nation right now has to speak up,” he said. “A cease-fire is not the end of the conflict, it just stops the murder of innocent people.”

Rep. Betty McCollum and Rep. Ilhan Omar, both of Minnesota, joined the cal...

## Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators flood Columbus Circle

NEW YORK CITY (PIX 11) — Thousands of demonstrators flooded Columbus Circle Friday in support of Palestine more than a month since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Demonstrators are calling the bombings in Gaza a humanitarian crisis and are demanding an end to U.S. aid to Israel.

Nijmah Ayesh is frustrated with the war’s impact on her family in Gaza.

“We have family in Gaza, yes we do, and their homes have been destroyed,” said Ayesh. “We go to the mosque every day. There are prayers for the dead. There are no more tears to shed for the children in Palestine and yet our government supports not the peaceful side of the quote, unquote Israel. They’re supporting the IDF killing, bombing children.”

Tensions escalated when a counter-protestor came face to face with ralliers holding a sign and waving an Israeli flag while denouncing Hamas and showing his support for Israel.

“They’ve been attacked their entire existence,” pro-Israel demonstrator Gregory Jachts said. “They make a peace agreement and the next day they’re attacked. They defend themselves, and how can you not defend someone. They come in, they attack kids at a music festival, they behead babies, they kill and rape women, they kill parents in front of their children.”

The protest spilled into the streets, stopping traffic, as ralliers made their way through Manhattan. Their calls echo the urgent need for diplomatic solutions.

“I think we got to show Israel it has to stop,” said pro-Palestine demonstrator Jose Rosete. “There’s only one solution, two states Palestine and Israel living together. That’s the only way.”

Demonstrators on both sides of the conflict have been rallying across the Tri-state area since the start of the war with more events planned in the coming days....

## Protesters in Evans support Palestinians, Mideast cease-fire

EVANS, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - Due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas that most recently erupted in early October, people gathered in front of the Columbia County courthouse for a peaceful protest supporting Palestinians and asking for a cease-fire.

“It breaks our hearts. And the least we can do is be here, we are their voice. We are their only voice, you know, and they’re asking for cease-fire,” said Rama Dawood, who attended the protest.

They want the violence to stop, especially on the children.

“Children have dreams, they have names, they have achievements, they want to speak about them and their life. And now by doing this, by killing the children, there is no way that those children have the chance to speak about their dreams, what they wanted to be in the future,” said Fayek Ismail, another protester in Evans.

He came out to the Columbia County Courthouse because he says he has family that lives in Gaza.

“My house that I own was bombed. And the whole house is destroyed, my house. Am I a terrorist? Why did Israel target my house?” he said.

His brother is now separated from everyone he loves.

“Now he can’t reach the children, he can’t reach his wife, he can’t reach his sons,” said Ismail.

They are doing what they can to help.

“We can’t turn a blind eye to the evils that are being committed only because it makes us feel uncomfortable, only because we’ve seen enough of it,” said Fabiha Anwar, who attended the protest.

They are hoping that all of this will come to an end.

“We are asking for a fair resolution so that the Palestinians will live in peace beside the Israelis. We want to live together in peace,” said Ismail.

They told News 12 they plan on protesting Nov. 11 in the same spot.

“With the support of Boston University students, New England-based WGA members, as well as other regional unions and community groups, the Writers Guild of America announced it will picket Warner Bros. Discovery President & CEO David Zaslav at Boston University’s 150th All-Student Commencement Exercises,” the union said in a statement Thursday.

Jason Gordon, director of communications for the Writers Guild of America, East, confirmed Thursday that a protest is planned at the May 21 commencement at Nickerson Field.

The Writers Guild of America, whose members are on strike, plans to set up a picket line at Boston University’s commencement, where David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, will be the speaker, a spokesman said.

Commencement festivities are slated for 1 p.m.

More than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America, or WGA, stopped working last week in the first Hollywood strike in 15 years. Writers are protesting for better pay and job security, among other demands.

Critics argue Zaslav, who claimed almost $250 million in “excess pay” in 2022, epitomizes the vast pay disparity between writers and executives in Hollywood.

“Right now, 11,500 WGA members across the country are on strike because companies — including Warner Bros. Discovery — refuse to negotiate a fair contract that addresses writers’ reasonable demands around pay, residuals, and the existential threat that AI poses to workers,” the WGAE statement said. “It is shameful that, in the midst of an action to preserve the future of work, Boston University would use a graduation ceremony to honor someone who is intent on destroying students’ prospects for building sustainable careers.”

BU spokesman Colin Riley said Thursday that the university had no comment and there was no change in plans for the commencement.

## Demonstrators rally in Jacksonville against Florida’s death penalty

‘Not a clear-cut issue’: Decision yet to be made in death penalty ruling for Nassau County deputy’s killer

Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Anti-death penalty advocates spoke out Wednesday, the eve of Florida’s first execution since 2019.

Donald Dillbeck is scheduled to be executed Thursday in Raiford. He was convicted of stabbing a woman to death in an attempted carjacking in a Tallahassee shopping mall parking lot in 1990.

Advocates like Abraham Bonowitz are hoping the execution is stayed.

“Donald Dillbeck in no other state could be executed,” said Bonowitz, president of Death Penalty Action.

He said that is because a jury sentenced Dillbeck to death by a vote of 8-4. The law in Florida has since changed to require a unanimous vote.

On the same day Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Dillbeck’s death warrant last month, he told Florida sheriffs during a winter conference that he would like to see the death penalty changed in the state.

When the legislative session resumes next month, lawmakers will consider bills that would change the required unanimous jury recommendation for a death sentence to be at least an 8-4 vote instead. They would also allow judges to override a jury’s recommendation for a life sentence.

The governor cited the Parkland school shooting massacre, where, last year, three jurors voted not to recommend a death sentence for the gunman who killed 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.

He said that he was disappointed by the decision and that he did not believe it represented the feelings of the community.

“Fine, have a supermajority, but you can’t just have one person so maybe 8 out of 12 have to agree or something,” DeSantis said. “But we can’t be in a situation where one person can just derail this.”

Bonowitz contends that the greater the dis...

COMPTON, Calif. (KABC) -- Dozens of supporters joined community youth leader Derrick Cooper in a march through the streets of Compton on Sunday to demand accountability after sheriff's deputies entered his home with guns drawn last month

Cooper, the founder of Compton's L.A. City Wildcats Youth Academy, says he has not slept well since sheriff's deputies entered his home in the middle of the night and arrested him.

"When this happened to me I stayed in a place of calmness, a place of resolution and a place of just trying to save my life," said Cooper.

Surveillance video shows deputies taking Cooper away in handcuffs in only a t-shirt and underwear. Cooper was escorted out of his home and detained.

Cooper was released a short time later.

The department says they were responding to an attempted burglary call at Cooper's youth academy, where he lives in the back room.

"The community is outraged by what has happened and they're tired of it. Right now what we need is accountability and we need some answers from LA County Sheriff's," Cooper said.

Cooper says deputies entered the academy by reaching through the mail slot and opening the front door, which, Cooper's lawyer sa...

## ‘Vision of the Trump campaign and Dordt were incongruent’: Sioux Center Trump rally moved to new venue

SIOUX CITY, Iowa (KCAU) — UPDATE: Dordt University has put out a statement about former President Donald Trump’s planned rally in Sioux Center, saying the event has moved.

The university said they invite presidential candidates of all political parties each campaign cycle, with the intent of the event being “educational in nature, including questions directly from Dordt students to the candidates.” Meanwhile, the Trump campaign desired a rally format.

In addition, the university also said that it understood that nothing would be publicized about Trump’s visit until the format was finalized after the new year.

“Ultimately, the vision of the Trump campaign and Dordt were incongruent, and the event will not take place at the university,” the statement read.

The Commit to Caucus Rally for Donald J. Trump has been rescheduled for the Terrace View Event Center in Sioux Center on January 5, 2024.

Terrace View Event Center said they will be able to hold 814 people, but they could not provide further comment. KCAU 9 has also reached out to the Trump campaign but hasn’t received any comment.

KCAU 9 also spoke with Sioux Center Police Chief Josh Koedam who said that they have yet to be in contact with the Secret Service about security for the event

PREVIOUS: Dordt University is pulling the plug on a planned Jan. 5 appearance on campus by former President Donald Trump.

The front-running GOP presidential candidate was scheduled to be in Sioux Center for a “Commit to Caucus” event at the university’s campus center, just 10 days before this year’s Iowa caucus.

Iowa state representative and Dordt faculty member Dr. Jeff Taylor confirmed to KCAU 9 that he had been working as a liaison between the university and the Trump campaign. Taylor said the decision to not host the Trump event was made last Friday by Dordt administrators.

## Rise up for Roe (Summit, NJ)

We are ALL born free and equal in dignity and rights. The Supreme Court of the U.S. and the United States Congress have failed in their obligation to protect, respect, and uphold our human rights. The women's wave delivered a blow to anti-freedom politicians in the 2022 midterms, and now we are taking the fight out of D.C. and into every single state in this country.

On January 22, 2023, the anniversary of Roe V Wade, as we mourn the loss of nearly 50 years of constitutional protections, we send another clear message:

The midterms were just the beginning. We are not going gently. We are taking our fight to every state and every legislator in this country. We are putting all politicians at every level of government on notice: If you come for our families, our freedoms, or our future, we are coming for your seat. Our movement is strong. Our movement is growing.

We will Rise up for Roe!...

## Hundreds Take Stand Against Antisemitism At Fairfield Vigil

Community Corner Hundreds Take Stand Against Antisemitism At Fairfield Vigil The vigil was initiated by Fairfield mom, Ann Harvey.

An estimated 400-plus people attended "Fairfielders Together: Together Against Antisemitism, Together for the Safe Return of the Hostages and Together for Peace" last weekend in Fairfield. (RICHARD JACOBS PHOTOS LLC)

Information from Fairfield resident Ann Harvey

FAIRFIELD, CT — More than Four hundred community members gathered on the Fairfield Town Hall Green for a vigil entitled “Fairfielders Together: Together Against Antisemitism, Together for the Safe Return of the Hostages and Together for Peace.” The vigil was initiated by Fairfield mom, Ann Harvey, who said “our town is special, we support one another. Let’s bring the whole community together, in a peaceful, positive way. . . to say no to antisemitism in our town.” The event was planned by Ann along with other Fairfield moms and was supported by synagogues including Or Hadash, B’nai israel, Rodeph Shalom and Chabad, as well as the Fairfield County Jewish Federation. In attendance were many of the local and state elected officials including State Representatives Cristin McCarthy Vahey, Jennifer Leeper, Sarah Keitt and State Senator Tony Hwang. The current First Selectwoman, Brenda Kupchick and First Selectman Elect Bill Gerber were also both in attendance. In addition, many members of then Fairfield RTM were also in attendance. Leading the vigil was Board of Selectman member Nancy Lefkowitz, who shared some of her experiences on the campaign trail that showed her antisemitism was alive and well in Fairfield long before the horrific attacks on October 7th.

Rabbi Joshua Ratner, Rabbi Evan Schultz, Rabbi Shlame Landa, Rabbi Jim Prosnit and Cantor Sarah Metzger all spoke and shared prayers. Rabbi Ratner read a prayer for the hostages and Rabbi Schultz sang a prayer asking everyone to hold up the posters of the 240 kidnap victims that were distributed throughout the crowd. Reflecti...

## R.I. leaders push for assault weapons ban: ‘The time has come to act’

“The time for words has passed,” said Goldstein. “The bills have been heard year after year. They have been debated again and again. The arguments are always the same. What has changed is the body count, and it keeps going up. The time has come to act.”

PROVIDENCE — Governor Daniel J. McKee, Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos, Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein, and other state officials and faith leaders led a rally at the State House with about 150 advocates from Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action, and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence in support of gun legislation that would ban assault weapons and require secure storage of all firearms.

Advertisement

Last year, the tragic shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and a racist mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., were the catalysts that pushed the General Assembly to overwhelmingly support three gun bills — limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds, prohibiting the open carry of long guns in public, and raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy long guns and ammunition. McKee signed the bills last June. Since then, the attorney general’s office has brought 83 cases of people illegally possessing high-capacity gun magazines.

Bills to ban assault weapons and require gun owners to store their firearms safely, or face civil and criminal penalties, didn’t move forward last year.

But now, with new mass shootings across the country, more than one every day, supporters of the legislation said it’s time.

The governor and lieutenant governor urged the backing of what they called “common-sense” legislation.

## Pro-Palestine Activists Rally at Brooklyn Museum

Around 20 pro-Palestinian protesters held a guerilla action at the Brooklyn Museum today, December 8, ahead of a mass protest at the institution tomorrow. The group, affiliated with the activist organizations Decolonize This Place and Within Our Lifetime, demanded that the New York City institution sever its ties with donors financially tied to Israel.

Around 2pm, the protesters unfurled several banners in the museum’s third-floor hall, including a large sign that read “Brooklyn Museum, No Silence on Genocide.” Smaller sheets of fabric bore the phrases “No normalization of settler colonialism” and “Divest from genocide.” Security officers quickly told the protesters to leave and attempted to direct them to the stairwell. The activists instead marched through the open galleries, handing out pamphlets to museum visitors.

Activists called out the museum’s silence on Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza.

The document declared that the museum “remains silent” on the ongoing assault on Palestine and listed each museum board member who allegedly stands in implicit support of Israel and its military, such as board treasurer Neil Simpkins, executive advisor to the Blackstone company that reportedly pledged $7 million to Israel; and board chairman Barbara Vogelstein, who supported the 2017 Governors United campaign in which state governors condemned the Boycott, Divest, Sanctions (BDS) movement and voiced their support for Israel. The pamphlet also cited corporate donors with financial ties to Israel, including the Bank of New York Mellon, which facilitates a charity for the Israel Defense Forces, and Citi, which pledged $1 million to humanitarian organizations operating in the nation. Hyperallergic could not independently verify all of the claims made in the leaflet.

Almost 400 people, including over 60 Brooklyn Museum workers, signed a November 12 statement penned by staff members at the institution urging their employer “to unequivocally recognize Israel’s ongoing acti...

## ‘No days off’: Durham city sanitation workers rally for ‘fair wages’ and permanent employment

DURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) — There’s a good chance you’ve seen their trucks zipping through Durham neighborhoods or city streets.

“We are on the front line of everything,” Solid Waste Management employee Jimmy Ivey said. “We’re in the neighborhoods where everything goes down.”

That’s why Ivey and his fellow waste management workers believe they deserve a little more.

City sanitation and public works employees rallied in downtown Durham for what they say are fair wages before the city council meeting Tuesday night.

“Working for North Carolina in the City of Durham and can’t afford to even live here, it’s defeating the purpose,” Ivey said.

The Local 150 Union started a petition asking for an immediate $5,000 bonus, pay for all work outside of their job titles and for the hiring of all temporary workers as permanent.

“Every day during COVID, we worked,” Solid Waste Management worker James Davis said. “No days off.”

According to the independent union, wages have gone up by 15 percent since 2019, but inflation and cost of living have increased by nearly 23 percent.

“We basically put our lives, our family lives and coworkers and our own [on the line] just to make sure our city stayed safe during a real hazardous time,” employee Antonio Smith said.

Earlier in the summer, the city approved a new budget that includes up to an 8 percent pay bump for general employees.

“We are the ones, city workers are the ones that make Durham great,” Ivey said.CBS 17 reached out to the city for comment but did not hear back....

## More than 1,000 celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day in march, commemoration in SF

The Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration opened on Monday in San Francisco with the gospel chorus ensemble from Glide Memorial Church and a spirited welcome from minister Marvin K. White.

More than a thousand people of every color marched from the Caltrain station to Yerba Buena Gardens to celebrate. Among the crowd were dozens of community organizers and city officials.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed opened her remarks by recalling events past.

“I remember in the '80s and the '90s when we would march from Caltrain to Bill Graham Civic Auditorium," she said, calling out the many organizations present at Monday's event.

"They are doing what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. chose to do when he fought the fight with nonviolence, pushing for peace. They are using love as a weapon to overcome hatred. They are using light as a weapon to overcome darkness. Let's continue year-round to honor Dr. King's legacy with our deeds, with our action and our words."

“It takes the hood to save the hood," said Rudy Corpuz, executive director for United Playaz, who proudly comes from San Francisco's Sixth District. He grew up on Sixth Street.

People took to the streets to honor the civil rights icon on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Events took place across the Bay Area, with locals celebrating MLK by honoring his legacy and giving back to those in need. Pete Suratos reports.

"I'm a Filipino. It doesn't matter if you Black, white or peppermint stripe. I fight for the underdog, and so I want to say this: If you not with the movement and you just with the moment, get your butt out the way. The big war that's really being fought is within yourself," said Corpuz. "If you can get self-love within yourself then you can't spread that love. And that's what Gandhi did. That's what Martin Luther King Jr. did. And they all got that from God himself."

## WTAMU students protest President Wendler’s decision, canceling drag show

This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

CANYON, Texas (KAMR/KCIT) — Following West Texas A&M University President Walter Wendler’s letter to students, faculty and staff, students gathered to protest the drag show cancelation.

Outside of the Student Union, protesters marched, cheered and held signs with messages in favor of the drag show, condemning the messages in Wendler’s letter.

President of the Hispanic Student Association, Juan Aguinaga was a member of the planning committee for the drag show and said this has been in the works for months and doesn’t understand why the letter was sent last minute.

“It’s just concerning because the drag show was meant to be for the Trevor Project, which is an organization dealing with the prevention of suicide amongst LGBTQ teens and young adults,” said Aguinaga. “It’s just really disheartening to know the basis is in his email, against drag is a threat against womanhood, and he links it towards blackface. “So, I don’t really get the point he’s trying to make.”

As previously reported by myhighplains.com, Wendler references beliefs in Christianity several times throughout the email, supporting his reasoning for canceling the show.

Some WT students believe that Wendler made the right decision and hope students will open their minds.

“I’m a Christian myself, I live in the word, and it says that in Leviticus, that they will not enter the kingdom of heaven if they continue to their ways, and I feel bad for them,” said Zack Byrd, WT student in favor of Wendler’s decision. “Because I want them to be with me as I enter into the into heavens. They’re my brothers and sisters, and they are not doing well. They are going to die, that hurts me, because that’s those are Jesus kids.”

One student felt that the protest and drag show could be a learning experience for students and promote diversity on campus. Something that ...

## Candlelight vigil honors homeless lives lost in Duluth

DULUTH, MN. (Northern News Now) - Northlanders marched from the CHUM food shelf to Duluth City hall holding signs of remembrance for those who passed without having found a home.

At city hall, organizers with CHUM joined the group for a candlelight vigil Tuesday night. The names of those who died this year were read out loud, followed by a native drumming ceremony.

CHUM Street Outreach Coordinator Deb Holman said when it comes to understanding Duluth’s homeless problem, knowledge is power.

”I hear a lot of negativity about homelessness and I think people need to take the time and learn about it,” Holman said. ”There’s really not a lot to be afraid of, but I think people are scared of the unknown, so the more you can learn, the better you’ll be.”

At Tuesday’s vigil, homeless advocates who passed away this year were also honored for their work in the community.

## Hundreds of people throughout Milwaukee withstand the heat to protest GOP debate

Hundreds of people throughout Milwaukee withstand the heat to protest GOP debate

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Much of the Republicans' excitement over the debate was countered by several protests throughout the city.

For hours Wednesday, hundreds of protesters withstood the heat to speak out against the Republican candidates specifically, and the Republican agenda in general.

There were immigrants, musicians, and union workers among them, all fighting in different ways to make their voices heard.

The first demonstration began at 4:00 P.M., four blocks from Fiserv Forum.

Michael Elvord, an SEIU member, said, "I don't think the Republicans, with their rhetoric and the programs they have, are for the Black and brown community."

Then they took to the streets. Several labor groups, including SEIU and the Fight for $15 movement, demanded GOP candidates prioritize working people.

Union member Adrianna Pittman said, "I feel like they're going to listen to our complaints and get stuff done."

Kenosha Pastor Jonathan Barker led the second protest, just blocks away from Fiserv Forum.

His group called on candidates and moderators to address climate change. "None of these candidates have any plan to protect our future from the climate emergency."

The third protest assembled at Red Arrow Park, where organizers said the GOP agenda is not welcome in Milwaukee.

Different groups supported immigrant rights, reproductive rights, voting rights, and workers' rights.

Richard Tremarello, a union musician, said, "We kind of see this as them coming in and trying to influence independent voters. So we want to show them we're still here."

They, too, marched to Fiserv Forum....

## ‘Justice for Sara’ community rallies for pedestrian safety after tragedy

HONOLULU (KHON2) — Dozens showed up to demand justice for Sara Yara, the 16-year-old McKinley High School student who was struck while crossing the street on a marked crosswalk. Police said the suspected driver was speeding; and now, her mother and the community want this tragedy to bring about change.

Through honks, posters and photos, a community remembered Yara. The teenager was killed on Wednesday. Feb. 15 as she crossed Kapiolani Boulevard; it was supposed to be another regular day on her way to school.

What’s going on around the globe. Find out in International News

Her mother, Chevy Saniatan. is leading efforts to prevent another senseless death. She is full of courage and wants to see changes as she knows her daughter’s death was preventable.

“With the lord’s help, we are going to move mountains. We need to move mountains just to save another life,” Saniatan said. “My daughter was only 12 inches away from the sidewalk that could’ve been prevented if there was no speed. I mean, they took a life too soon. So, now, we have to fight for her voice now that she’s not here.”

Honolulu Police Department traffic safety division attend the rally on Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023 in Honolulu, Hawai’i. Sara Yara’s family members attend the rally on Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023 in Honolulu, Hawai’i.

Dozens of friends, family and classmates have left flowers and handwritten notes for Yara at the intersection of the crash.

Yara is described as quiet, kind and always friendly. However, many are still trying to process the tragedy and are left with many questions.



The alleged driver has a long history of traffic infractions, and the incident puts a spotlight on traffic and pedestrian safety once again.

Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke was at Yasa’s rally and said this case needs to be examined closely.

Luke said, “We need to really look at the situation because clearly traffic laws weren’t enough; enforcement wasn’t enough. So, we have to do something different.”

As for changes at the inter...

## ‘Don’t silence the people’: VP Harris speaks at rally for ‘The Tennessee Three’

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Friday at Fisk University to show support for the Tennessee lawmakers removed from the House after protesting for stricter gun laws following the Covenant School mass shooting.

Harris met with the lawmakers, known as the “Tennessee Three,” before her speech at the rally held at Fisk.

Vice President Harris arrives in Nashville to meet with "Tennessee Three"

“The children should be able to live and be safe and go to school and not be in fear,” she said. “A democracy says you don’t silence the people. You do not stifle the people. You don’t turn off their microphones when they are speaking. You don’t turn off their mic when they are talking about the importance of life and liberty.”

Harris repeatedly defended the lawmakers, Rep. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, for advocating for children’s safety.

“Let’s understand the underlying issue is about fighting for the safety of our children,” Harris said. “It’s been years now where they are taught to read and write and hide in a closet and be quiet if there’s a mass shooter at their school, where our children, who have God’s capacity to learn and lead, who go to school in fear.”

At the rally, she called for stricter background checks and more restrictions on assault rifles.

“Let’s not fall for the false choice — either you’re in favor of the Second Amendment or you want reasonable gun safety laws,” Harris said. “We can and should do both.”

The rally at Fisk included city and community leaders showing support for the three lawmakers. Mayor John Cooper introduced Harris to the stage.

President Joe Biden also shared his thoughts of the expulsion vote on Twitter. “The expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and unprecedented,” part of the tweet said.

Biden spoke with the lawmakers Friday and thanked them for their leadership in seeking to ban assault weapons and standing up for democratic values. The o...

## More than 300 people experiencing homelessness have died on Denver's streets this year. They'll be honored at a vigil Thursday

The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless will host the 34th annual event.

The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless will honor 312 people who have died on the streets of Denver so far in 2023.

The Homeless Person’s Memorial Vigil will begin Thursday at 5 p.m. outside of the Denver City & County Building. The annual memorial is meant to highlight the ongoing crisis of people living on the streets and facing the elements.

The event will feature memorials and a reading of 312 names out loud, the most in the 34-year-old event’s history, said Cathy Alderman, the coalition’s spokeswoman.

“It’s essentially a funeral,” Alderman said. “And in many instances it will be the only opportunity for some of these individuals to be honored and recognized.”

Each year, the coalition gathers its list of names from local service providers, the state’s Homeless Management Information System and local community members. Death numbers rose this year due to an overall spike in people experiencing homelessness, Alderman said.

“As that population grows, we see more deaths on the street,” she said.

The rise comes as the deadline approaches for a first benchmark in Mayor Mike Johnston’s ambitious campaign promise to end homelessness in four years — something no other mayor has done.

Johnston launched an ambitious short-term plan the day he took office, estimated to cost taxpayers more than $48 million, to bring 1,000 people living on the streets indoors into housing and shelter by the end of the year.

ADVERTISEMENT

The House1000 effort has stumbled over transparency issues. The city’s dashboard says 607 people have been moved indoors, with outcomes including moving into hotels, leased units, and reunifying with families.

Thursday’s vigil will focus mostly on the lives lost this year. Attendees can donate warm winter clothing such as jackets, socks and hats at the event.

“We’ll also have a board that people can sign onto that expresses their respect for the individuals who passed away t...

## Students pepper-sprayed following race-related protest in San Bernardino

A peaceful protest against racism at Indian Springs High School in San Bernardino on Tuesday, Feb. 28, eventually became violent and led to campus security using pepper spray on some students, school officials said.

At around 11:30 a.m., during the students’ fourth period, a dozen students organized to peacefully protest racism. Student leaders, according to Maria Garcia, communications officer for the San Bernardino City Unified School District, had an issue with a teacher and students thus decided to protest.

The protest continued to grow and as more students joined, the protest became violent as students headed to the classroom of the teacher they had an issue with.

The students tried to get into the teacher’s classroom and the vice principal attempted to disband the protest. The vice principal was then assaulted and campus officers used pepper spray to disband the students, Garcia said.

The protest ended, the school went under lockdown and students were release in a staggered fashion.

Some students stayed for group conversation with other administrators.

Garcia said that in response to the incident, the school district plans to bring in additional administrators and district police officers to ensure safety. Additionally, the school will hold meetings allowing for groups of students to talk among themselves and the staff about their grievances.

“It will be safe for students to come to school tomorrow,” Garcia said.

Two students were sent to the nurse’s office, where one declined to be examined. The other was treated for a minor irritation and returned to class, Garcia said. Otherwise, there were no injuries.

The district is investigating the cause of the protest and what issues the students have with the teacher in question; and is considering potential disciplinary action against some of the involved students....

## People gather on the Louisiana State Capitol steps to protest potential arrest of Donald Trump

People gather on the Louisiana State Capitol steps to protest potential arrest of Donald Trump

BATON ROUGE- People gathered on the steps of the Louisiana State Capitol after former president Donald Trump said he would be arrested and asked his supporters to protest Tuesday.

Although there was no arrest, a group of Republicans from East Baton Rouge Parish took action.

“What this is, is a perversion of our justice system and it can not be allowed to happen. That's why we're here. To stand up and say what is happening in New York city is wrong,” Woody Jenkins, former state chairman for Donald Trump, said.

Jenkins served as state chairman in 2016. He says the actions of the Manhattan District Attorney’s office is a ploy.

“We don’t need to try to rig the election by taking the leading candidate and trying to say they can’t run because that's what it’s really all about,” Jenkins said.

Trump’s possible arrest is in relation to an investigation by the Manhattan DA's office. They’ve been looking into Trump's associates allegedly paying adult movie star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an affair between the two.

Tuesday, supporters said the accusation will not hold up....

## Atherton High School students hold walkout in protest of proposed Kentucky bills they say unfairly target LGBTQ+ community

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Students at Atherton High School walked out of class Tuesday afternoon in protest of two bills introduced by some Kentucky lawmakers.

Staff members at the school said they were aware of the walkout, during which students chanted "Kill the bill."

The students said they feel recently filed bills, House Bill 173 and House Bill 177, unfairly target the LGBTQ+ community.

House Bill 173 would allow teachers to refer to students as the name and gender on their original birth certificate or school enrollment documents, regardless of the students' pronoun preference. It would also require parents to be notified about changes to their child's gender expression.

House Bill 177 is a "parental rights bill" that bans teaching on gender identity and expression, sexual orientation and sexual relationships.

Both bills have been introduced in the House to the Committee on Committees.

## Rio Verde Foothills residents protest water cuts outside Scottsdale city hall

SCOTTSDALE, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) -- People living in Rio Verde Foothills continued their fight for water by holding a protest at Scottsdale City Hall on Tuesday night. On Jan. 1, the city cut off the neighborhood from its water supply, citing the drought. Their water woes were not on the agenda, but folks wanted to make it clear to Mayor David Ortega and councilmembers that they were not dropping this issue.

Residents gathered outside city hall around 4:30 p.m., holding signs during a protest organized by Cody Reim. “My community is beautiful. It’s the most special place in Arizona. And it it doesn’t have water for the people who live there, almost 1,000 homes, it’s going to die,” said Reim.

Another resident, who said she had to shower at the gym, is hoping Scottsdale will help its neighbors. “We’re not looking for a hand out. We’re looking for the right to buy water like anybody else. There’s definitely been like sleepless nights wondering if our family is going to have water. It’s a scary thing,” said Natalie Austin.

Protesters later made their way inside city hall for the Scottsdale City Council’s first meeting of the year. A few residents spoke during public comment, asking the council to reconsider their decision to stop water hauling into Rio Verde Foothills. They’re hoping the city will process water from EPCOR, a Canadian water utility company offering to supply residents with water.

People we spoke to say this is a temporary solution, necessary to survive until EPCOR is up and running on its own in about three years. Some community members raised money for litigation against the City of Scottsdale, hoping to reach a solution.

Now, Republican State Rep. David Cook is supporting Rio Verde Foothills residents. He said government leaders should not treat their constituents this way. “What I’m telling the Scottsdale mayor is, ‘You’ve made this problem my problem, and I’m going to find a solution for those people. So, I hope you’re willing to come along with me,’”...

## Dodger Stadium game-day workers protest, threaten to go on strike

Dodger Stadium game-day workers protest on Vin Scully Avenue outside Dodger Stadium before a game between the Dodgers and New York Yankees on Saturday. The union representing ushers, grounds crew, security and janitors is threatening to go on strike next month if it does not receive a new contract. (Jorge Castillo / Los Angeles Times) More

Hundreds of Dodger Stadium game-day workers could go on strike as early as next month if the Dodgers do not meet their contract demands by the end of June, the union representing the employees said after more than 80 people gathered to protest outside the ballpark Saturday.

The workers, according to SEIU USWW officials, are asking for a wage raise of 43% to 45% over five years and an increase in the employer’s healthcare contribution from the Dodgers. The union said it is representing approximately 500 ushers, groundskeepers, security officers, and other stadium workers in the negotiations. The two sides are scheduled to return to the bargaining table Friday.

“In my 27 years working with the SEIU, representing these workers, we have never had to go on strike,” SEIU USWW President David Huerta said. “But the circumstances we're looking at — when you look at inflation, you look at the profitability of this organization, the cost of living — the wages that are being negotiated now, these workers understand that this is a moment for them, to be able to negotiate what they consider what they need to be able to survive in this city.

“And I think this organization that represents the Dodgers, that represents the city of Los Angeles needs to be cognizant of the fact that they're just not a ballclub. They're an employer that employs a lot of people and those folks have to be able to have livable wages.”

Union officials said they have been negotiating with the Dodgers since November. Their last deal, a five-year arrangement that included an 18% raise over its lifespan, expired Jan. 31. They have since been working on the expired contra...

## Intermountain staff hold demonstration, board expresses commitment to residential program

HELENA — Earlier this month, Intermountain confirmed it was temporarily closing its residential program in Helena, which provides long-term behavioral health services to children ages four to 13. On Monday, Intermountain staff held a public demonstration, asking the community to stand by them, as the organization’s directors said they remain committed to the program and their clinical model.

Monday evening, dozens of people gathered on the street corner in front of the Montana State Capitol, holding signs asking those driving by to “Stand With Staff” and “Honk for Kids.”

Recent Stories from ktvh.com

“We are looking for being able to continue Intermountain treatment the way Intermountain does it,” said Katie Smith, who works as a case manager for Intermountain, and previously provided home support services.

Those in attendance for the “Hope for Intermountain” event included current and former employees, as well as many who’ve been served by Intermountain programs.

Amy Chartier says her daughter Kaylee went through the residential program about five years ago, and is now in a much better place.

“They made me feel like I was part of a family, and not just some other kid that was just there,” Kaylee said Monday.

Amy Chartier said Intermountain Residential is an outlet Montana can’t afford to lose.

“I am really heartbroken that the talks are even there to shut this place down, because it offers such a good atmosphere and opportunity for families that are struggling or kids that are struggling to be part of a family,” she said. “It offered our family the opportunity to work through some serious issues.”

Jonathon Ambarian

Currently, 16 children in the residential program are set to be discharged later this month. Intermountain leaders say they are working to find solutions for those kids and their families.

However, many people say there’s simply no comparable alternative for what Intermountain does – and certainly not in Montana.

“What the community needs to k...

## Organizer defends pro-Palestinian rallies in the Quad Cities

DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held each Saturday at various locations in the Quad Cities for the past month. In the beginning, there were about a couple dozen people, but this has since grown to well over one hundred participants.

James is a citizen of the Quad Cities. He works here and is studying at a local college to advance his career in engineering. On the weekends, he leads rallies in support of Palestinians and their struggles amid the war between Israel and Hamas.

Health officials say the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 13,000 amid Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. This is why James has organized these weekly rallies calling for peace.

James prefers to be identified by only his first name due to threats he has received, for what he says is retaliation against his opposition to Israel’s military actions in Gaza. However, he believes his stance against Israel is misunderstood and those threatening him do not understand his intentions.

He wants to set the record straight.

“The Palestinians deserve one thing, and that’s their God given right to have equality,” said James, “no matter what regime they’re under or what state they’re under, that is what they deserve. And they are not getting it and they need it. And I feel like it’s right to demand for it.”

“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” is a chant that has been a source of controversy at pro-Palestinian rallies across the nation. And it can be heard at the local rallies as well.

It is a political slogan referring to the geographical area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea, which includes all of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. It can be used to suggest the annihilation of the state of Israel.

James says this has been misinterpreted. He believes Palestinians deserve to be free regardless of a single or two-state solution.

“From the river to the sea, Palestinians will be free means that they will have equality and justice and free...

BOWLING GREEN Ky. – Members of the UAW Local 2164 held a rally today to stand in solidarity with their brothers and sisters on strike across the United States.

Although the General Motors Plant in Bowling Green is not currently striking, Brian Ferrett, president of the 2164, thinks it is good for the morale of the workers.

“It’s just a waiting game. And, you know, we’re trying to keep them engaged by having things like this,” Ferrett said.

In general, local union members here in Warren County want to do their part, even if that means continuing to work, to support their friends and colleges however they can. Joel Battisti, a paint department team leader at the GM plant, enjoys seeing the turn out at the rally.

“I’m one of the senior employees, and it feels real good that you see the younger union members coming out here showing solidarity,” Battisti said.

When asked if he had anything to say to striking UAW Battisti replied, “Hold the line.”...

## Progressive agriculture groups rally for land access, climate-smart policies in farm bill ⋆ Michigan Advance

WASHINGTON — Farmers and leaders from more than 20 progressive agricultural groups gathered this week to march on the U.S. Capitol, and promote climate solutions and underserved producers as priority issues for lawmakers in the upcoming farm bill.

“As farmers, we are close to the land. We love the land. We understand the sanctity and the sacredness of water. We understand the essence of life,” said Duane “Chili” Yazzie, a regenerative farmer in New Mexico and member of Shiprock Chapter of the Navajo Nation, to dozens of demonstrators at Freedom Plaza Tuesday.

“We demand that we — as small farmers, as the BIPOC farmers, as the farmers that need a helping hand — must have the provisions in the farm bill that make sense to us.”

During the three-day “Rally for Resilience,” headed by the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, attendees met with lawmakers and hosted a demonstration at Freedom Plaza. Organizers called for sustainable practices, decreased industry consolidation, and improved land access for people of color and family farmers.

The farm bill is a multiyear omnibus spending law which authorizes an array of agricultural and food programs, including federal crop insurance, food stamp benefits, international food aid and farm resource conservation.

The roughly $500 billion bill is renewed close to every five years, and includes mandatory spending that must be in line with previous farm bills. The legislation is up for renewal in 2023.

Sustainable agriculture and climate change

Speakers at the Rally for Resilience lobbied for legislators to embrace regenerative agriculture in the upcoming farm bill, and help farmers become part of the climate solution amid worsening growing conditions.

Regenerative agriculture is a set of farming and grazing practices that work to restore soil ecosystem health, and can sequester carbon dioxide while increasing resilience to climate change.

“It makes me angry, and it makes me frustrated to see people in positions of p...

## Gov. Josh Shapiro, others rally to denounce antisemitism – NBC10 Philadelphia

Students, lawmakers and religious leaders joined forces Sunday at a temple in Philadelphia to strongly denounce antisemitism on college campuses and in their communities.

The gathering at Congregation Rodeph Shalom came one day after University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned amid criticism over her testimony at a congressional hearing. Magill was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.

“I have seen Pennsylvanians take actions big and small, and both matter, to combat antisemitism,” Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said at the event. “I’ve seen it here in Philadelphia where students raised their voices, where students made sure they were heard in the halls of power at their university, and leadership was held accountable.”

Similar sentiments were voiced by U.S. Sen. Bob Casey Jr., a fellow Democrat, and student speakers from Harvard and Penn. Harvard President Claudine Gay also took part in the congressional hearing along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth. They also drew criticism for their lawyerly answers.

Eitan Linhart, a sophomore at Penn, discussed his experience with what he called the rise in antisemitism on the school's campus. He cited a Jewish fraternity being defaced with graffiti that read “The Jews are Nazis” and spoke of friends who no longer wear yarmulkes on campus out of fear.

“What surprises me is not the hatred," Linhart said. “What surprises me is the indifference.”...

## Healthcare workers march for safety at Good Samaritan; Legacy says metal detectors coming

PORTLAND, Ore. (KPTV) - In the wake of a tragedy, healthcare workers convened at Legacy Health’s Good Samaritan Hospital in northwest Portland on the same day the hospital system announced increased security measures.

Hundreds of people participated in a march following the death of 44-year-old Bobby Smallwood who was shot and killed standing between hospital staff and an intruder.

RELATED: Portland Police release timeline of events in deadly hospital shooting

“His job was to protect us, and he gave up his life doing that,” said Hilda, a healthcare worker. “What a hero.”

Suzy House said, “I want to make sure the next tragedy we have, we did everything we could.”

“It’s time to do better at this hospital,” added Judy Tobolski, whose daughter works at the hospital.

On Saturday, Legacy said in a news release it will be adding increased security measures. It said it will install metal detectors and bag search at every hospital beginning as soon as Monday. Legacy said it will be installing bullet-slow film on hospital main entrances, emergency departments and on glass in internal entrances. It will also issue Tasers to lead security officers with plans to expand their use. The full statement on increased security measures can be read below.

These are the top three actions we will take immediately: We will install metal detectors with bag search at every Legacy hospital. All patients and visitors will enter our hospitals through controlled access points with metal detection and bag search. Certain hospitals will see metal detectors installed next week on Monday. Other hospitals will see metal detectors soon. We will install bullet-slow film on the hospital main entrances and emergency departments and on glass in internal entrances. We have equipped our lead security officers with Tasers and will expand the use of Tasers to all security officers who have completed training and certification. We have begun to develop a second phase of actions, and that work will conti...

## Activists host march demanding changes to NU stadium plan

Submitted by Northwestern Accountability Alliance

The Northwestern Accountability Alliance will hold a protest march, car caravan and rally in opposition to Northwestern University’s plans to create an untaxed commercial entertainment zone in a residential neighborhood – and their refusal to enter into a community benefits agreement. The groups forming the Alliance believe that Northwestern’s request to rezone the new Ryan Field stadium as a for-profit entertainment complex would significantly disrupt the livability of Evanston and surrounding communities while bringing dubious benefit to residents.

WHO:

The Northwestern Accountability Alliance (consisting of the Community Alliance for Better Government, the Most Livable City Association, Reclaim Evanston, Northwestern University Graduate Workers, Fossil Free Northwestern and Students Organizing for Labor Rights.)

WHEN:

5 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 26

## Students call for end to gun violence with rally at Boston Common - Boston News, Weather, Sports

BOSTON (WHDH) - Students from across the region came together on the Boston Common on Friday calling for an end to gun violence.

Organizers of the demonstration said they wanted to honor the victims of the recent shooting at Michigan State University earlier this month.

“This one really hit home being on a college campus and being on a campus that has a lot of access in a city,” one student said. “A lot of us can relate to that going to a college in Boston.”

Sen. Ed Markey was in attendance to lend his support as students said they also want to see meaningful change for U.S. gun laws.

“What we really wanted to do was to show some generational support,” said Mark Lannigan, president of Tufts Democrats. “Our generation is really heavily impacted by gun violence.”

“This really is an issue that impacts a ton of people, a lot of people — communities across the country,” Lannigan continued.

## Protests continue as Florida Senate prepares to vote on six-week abortion ban

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Protests continue as Florida lawmakers consider legislation to ban abortion at six weeks.

The House version of the bill will have its last committee hearing Thursday morning. The Senate version is scheduled to be heard by the full Senate Thursday afternoon.

At a rally Wednesday, protesters called on Senate President Kathleen Passidomo to reject the legislation. They argued that it will disproportionately impact women who don’t have the money to travel to another state to get an abortion.

“The 15-week ban was bad enough. The six-week ban is a health risk, a death risk.”

Senate Bill 300 provides exceptions for rape or incest, and the bill includes language aiming to protect the lives of mothers. But Democrats argue the bill makes it difficult for women who fall into these categories to benefit from these exceptions because it will be challenging to meet the rules’ qualifications.

In a committee meeting Tuesday, the bill’s sponsor, Republican Erin Grall, said her goal is to protect unborn children.

“For decades now, Florida has been a nationwide leader in defending the rights of the unborn,” Grall said. “The legislation before you today will make Florida a beacon of hope for those who understand that life is sacred and must be protected.”

But pro-choice advocates argue the bill is an attack on women’s reproductive freedom.

“We’re here expressing our outrage that this abortion ban is even being considered, while abortion rights are advancing in other parts of the world,” said Andrea Mercado with Florida Rising at Wednesday’s rally. “Across Latin America, you’re seeing legalization of abortion and decriminalization of abortion. Here in Florida, we’re marching backwards.”

At Tuesday’s committee meeting, Republicans rejected two amendments proposed by Democrats. One of them would have provided an exception if giving birth would cause the mother severe mental impairment. The other would have removed the 24-hour waiting period required bef...

## Protesters at MnDOT in Detroit Lakes demand immediate halt to Hwy. 34 logging

DETROIT LAKES — Protesters angry about tree-cutting on the Highway 34 scenic byway gathered outside of MnDOT district headquarters in Detroit Lakes on Friday, holding signs and calling on MnDOT to immediately stop the cutting.

“I’m concerned that MnDOT hasn’t listened to the public,” said Matthew Davis of Detroit Lakes. “They don’t seem to value the scenic byway like we do — they’re treating it like any other road. It’s just bad public policy.”

To the consternation of residents and others who love that stretch of roadway, in the name of safety MnDOT is now clearing out trees 65 feet on either side of the center line on a 21-mile stretch of Highway 34 between Detroit Lakes and Park Rapids. It’s part of the Lake Country Scenic Byway.

In spite of the uproar, the local Minnesota Department of Natural Resources “is not bending, they’re not listening to the public,” Davis added. “We’re all for safety, but at what point does safety trump every other value we have?”

The tree removal is part of a $15.7 million reclamation and resurfacing project set for this summer on Highway 34, but the roadwork could have been done without touching the trees, noted Jen Johnson of Detroit Lakes.

“They took a simple resurfacing project, and for some reason decided to take the trees down, thinking it would be safer,” she said. But the trees keep the winter winds and blowing snow under control, she added. Unlike Highway 10 between Detroit ...

## Philadelphia hospital forms task force to help curb gun violence

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Advocates took a stand against gun violence Friday at the Chester County Courthouse. Cease Fire PA wore orange as they held a rally to kick off Gun Violence Awareness Month.

Survivors and gun control advocates came together to honor those lost and pushing for the state legislature to pass more comprehensive gun safety measures.

Many hospitals in Philadelphia feel like a war zone with so many gunshot victims. The team At Jefferson's Einstein Medical Center is working hard to save lives in the hospital and the community.

"I didn't know if I was ever going to walk again," said Thomas Hunter.

Hunter was temporarily paralyzed after being shot in the abdomen three years ago.

"It can happen to anybody," he said.

Knowing the agony of gun violence, the 26-year-old now works at Jefferson's Einstein Medical Center, helping other victims and their families.

"I meet them where they're at. I instill them with hope, resiliency and empowerment," Hunter said.

Einstein's trauma center is ground zero for gun carnage. Hundreds of victims end up there and it's taking an emotional toll on the staff.

"Every single shift, they feel that burden of the constant gun violence in our city," said Sarah Misuro, who is a nurse. "It weighs very heavily on you – everybody."

Orange flowers are planted in front of the hospital for Gun Violence Awareness Day and people are being encouraged to wear orange to honor victims and their families.

"Our healthcare team struggles with this every day," said Juanita Way, with Jefferson Einstein Medical Center.

Desperate to do something, the team at Einstein sold t-shirts and raised $10,000 to buy gun locks that they're giving away in the hospital.

"We aren't making a dent in it, so we gotta figure out something to do," Way said.

Way, along with Einstein's gun violence prevention task force, thinks the gun locks can help protect children and reduce accidental shootings, as well as make gun owners more responsible.

For Way, who ...

## Possible PG&E rate hikes prompt protests from different organizations

It's beginning to get colder, which means people are raising thermostats, and if PG&E gets its way, energy bills are likely to go up more.

Bills have already risen 38% over the last three years. According to the Public Advocate Office for the state Public Utilities Commission. So, that is three times higher than the rate of inflation, and they are set to go up even more.

The California Public Utilities Commission is set to weigh three proposals for rate hikes, ranging from 9% to 26%. So, what is the main difference between these three proposals?

The higher the rate hike is the more money PG&E gets to bury power lines. The goal is to eventually bury 10,000 miles of power lines across the state to reduce the risk of wildfires. As of today, only about 300 miles have been completed.

With higher bills on the horizon, calls are getting louder for more transparency. Dozens of people representing various organizations showed up to at the CPUC building in San Francisco on Wednesday to demand more transparency and accountability for PG&E.

"We want to know where the money is coming from and how much they're spending and we deserve to know," said Sam Liccardo.

He's the former mayor of San Jose and is now involved with the newly formed group called FAIR. It's an umbrella organization representing housing advocates, business leaders, labor unions and environmental groups.

They are all coming together to push back against PG&E.

Liccardo said PG&E is such a massive political force and that it's been able to push through rate increases without being transparent about where and how the money is being spent. They said that hurts ratepayers including small businesses.

"I'm paying about $1,000 per month between both stores in electricity," said Lucas Schulte.

He and his wife, Wendy, own Good Common Sense Naturals. They make and sell organic body and bath products.

Schulte worries not only about how a rate hike will impact their business but about the impact to their customers...

## Residents and local leaders gather in Longmeadow, rally in support of Israel

LONGMEADOW, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Dozens took to the streets near Picknelly Field in support of Israel.

The event was attended by residents and local leaders who say it’s important to have their voices heard amid the ongoing war overseas.

Protestors say they are angry and heartbroken by the number of innocent civilians caught in the middle of the war.

One month after Hamas’ initial attack on Israel, many people brought signs and wore Israeli flags to protest to ongoing war overseas.

With hundreds of hostages still held captive in Gaza, people here in Longmeadow say they’re hoping by speaking up, change can happen.

Also joining in support, Senator John Velis, whose military experience and recent trips to Israel make this issue hit particularly close to home.

“I’m here to show my support for Israel but it’s being here to express my absolute condemnation [at] the horrific nature of what took place on October 7th,” Velis stated.

The senator says he’s standing in solidarity with the civilians held hostage, something he thinks everyone can stand behind.

For over an hour, participants gathered, held signs, and wore blue ribbons.

Participants said they were thrilled not only by the turnout but also at the number of drivers who showed their support by waving or honking.

## Protest with 70 pairs of shoes at State Capitol represent domestic violence victims killed by guns

Every year about 70 women and children are killed by their abusers. On Thursday supporters gathered in Lansing to honor domestic violence victims and call for change.

Seventy pairs of empty shoes were ceremonially placed on the Capitol steps in Michigan representing victims who will never walk this earth again domestic violence victims killed by a gun.

"Families that have been torn apart," said Celeste Kanpurwalla, Moms Demand Action Michigan. "Children who’ve lost a parent, parents who have lost children, and dreams that have been shattered."

The assemblage of shoes stands in silent testimony as a stark reminder of the lives at stake. A visual tableau of the 50 women and 20 children on average who advocates say die this way each year.

"There is a clear, undeniable connection between domestic violence and firearms and then assaultive conduct that follows," said Attorney General Dana Nessel.

This poignant congregation of supporters, survivors, and stakeholders united under a shared purpose to end gun violence. They want to pass legislation in the State House and Senate that would prevent anyone convicted in Michigan of a domestic violence charge from possessing a firearm for eight years after they do time.

"We need to turn our pain into power, we need to turn our grief into laws, and our mourning into more organizing," said Tanesha Ash-Shakoor, Voices of Color. "Each shoe represents a failure by us as a society to protect survivors of domestic violence."

Gun rights advocates like Rick Ector said he has worries about how the legislation might infringe on Second Amendment rights – especially because pinning down what qualifies as domestic violence can be difficult.

Also, Ector said eight years to him is an excessive amount of time. He also has concerns about people who may be falsely accused and railroaded by the system.

## Jewish students react to Georgetown 'vigil' for Hamas 'martyrs'

Georgetown University (GU) is the latest in a trend of schools holding “vigils” celebrating the “martyrs” of the “Palestinian resistance.”

On Thursday, the school’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter held a “Vigil for Our Martyrs” following last weekend’s attacks on Israeli civilians and Israeli military response. “Join us to mourn and honor the recent and ongoing massive loss of life, and to stand in solidarity with the struggle for Palestinian liberation,” the group announced on Instagram on Oct. 10.

[RELATED: UPDATED: NYU Law Student Bar Association prez blames Israel for brutal Hamas attacks on civilians in newsletter]

The post invited students to “[b]ring signs, flags, flowers, and wear [their] keffiyehs to show support.”





Campus Reform was on the ground at the vigil, where students stood in a circle wearing masks and keffiyehs. A speaker read out the names of deceased Palestinians before addressing students, stating that those who are pro-Israel are “a vocal minority.”





“Thank you to everyone who came to grieve and support each other at our vigil today,” Georgetown University’s SJP chapter posted on their Instagram story following the event. “Never let go of that part of your humanity that winces at pain. At our core, we are all motivated by our love for each other, and none of us are alone.”

The post-vigil Instagram story post

Jewish students made their opinions known regarding the vigil, taping a Star of David with “chai” (Hebrew for “life”) inside to the walls of buildings. In addition, they taped up posters featuring the names and faces of kidnapped Israelis.





The names and faces of kidnapped Israelis

“My parents actually escaped from Iran when they were teenagers because they were Jewish,” one student explained. “They were born in the Middle East and they had to leave the country because they were killing all the Jews [...] I have a hard time calling anybody who willfully attacks civilians ‘martyrs.’”

## Students organize to protest legislative efforts to ban DEI initiatives at Texas colleges

More than a dozen UT Austin students held a sit-in inside the Capitol rotunda for four hours Thursday to protest part of the budget bill that would prohibit colleges and universities from using state funds for diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

Such practices include promoting diverse candidates for leadership positions and banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in regard to admissions and employment.

A.J. Walker, a member of Texas Students for DEI, which organized the protest, said the sit-in was important to show Texas lawmakers student support for DEI practices in higher education.

“The sit-in is to show our physical presence, to show that we are not going to back down and that we are here to defend diversity and inclusion,” she said. “We are urging people to testify … to let lawmakers know that DEI policies and initiatives aren't just something that they can do away with, that we will notice it and people will miss it and that it's not something that their constituents want removed.”

UT Austin senior Izabella De la Garza was among those who submitted written testimony against the DEI ban.

“I could not disagree with the proposal to ban using state funds for DEI programs more,” she wrote in her testimony to the committee. “I am Latina and these programs have made me feel more comfortable in college. College in Austin was a different environment for me and I found solace in DEI programs, which welcomed me.”

Despite the students’ opposition, the House Appropriations Committee gave final approval to the two-year budget bill Thursday; it now goes to the full House for debate.

De la Garza, who is also with Texas Students for DEI, said the sit-in was only the beginning of actions the group plans to take. She said the organization hopes to involve students from Texas A&M, other UT System campuses and other colleges in Austin like St. Edwards and Huston-Tillotson.

Last month, UT System Board of Regents Chairman Kevin Eltife announced a pa...

## Jersey City Vigil Held For Construction Worker In Fatal Fall

Crime & Safety Jersey City Vigil Held For Construction Worker In Fatal Fall "Attention is given to what is being built in Jersey City, little attention is given to how buildings are constructed," said the union.

The vigil, Feb. 8. (Alexia Merlo ) "Attention is given to what is being built in Jersey City, little attention is given to how buildings are constructed," said the union. (Google Maps) The vigil, Feb. 8. (Alexia Merlo )

JERSEY CITY, NJ — A local union held a vigil in Jersey City on Thursday, Feb. 8, for a 40-year-old construction worker who fell to his death last Friday.

The worker, Juan Jose Coc, lived in Fairview and leaves behind a wife and child, said the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA). As Jersey City continues its revitalization, construction workers are put at risk, the union said.

Mayor Steve Fulop, local workers, members of the community, clergy, public officials, and members of LIUNA attended the vigil at City Hall, 280 Grove St. "While much media attention is given to WHAT is being built in Jersey City," the group said in a release, "little attention is given to HOW buildings are constructed and the risk construction workers are forced to take on projects that offer minimal, if any, protections, substandard working conditions, and a business model that treats workers as expendable."

The union said, "As a member of the Jersey City community, LIUNA stands with concerned citizens to honor those hurt and killed on construction projects in Jersey City and to implore public officials that their leadership and help is needed to establish and enforce standards that protect construction workers." Reports said the 40-year-old man fell four stories from a building under construction at 859 Communipaw Ave., in the city's West Side near Lincoln Park.

Near the conclusion of the vigil, attendees illuminated candles and a roll call was read of 30 incidents in Jersey City where a worker was either seriously injured or killed on the job...

## Norwich teachers and parents plan rally before special board of education meeting

Members of the Connecticut Education Association planned to rally before a special Norwich Board of Education meeting Tuesday night. They are calling on the board to take action amid ongoing concerns with the district's leadership, according to Kate Dias, president of the CEA.

“We are trying to remind the board of education that they have no more time to deliberate. We need action," said Dias, who plans to be among those rallying outside Kelly Middle School Tuesday at 6 p.m.

According to the CEA, a climate survey found that 96% of teachers fear retaliation from the district's superintendent if they speak up about workplace issues. The CEA also said that 160 teachers -- more than half -- left the district since 2022.

"We are deeply alarmed," said Dias. “When we start to see staff who are leaving at alarming rates, high level of dissatisfaction, extraordinary levels of distrust -- that is indicative of management challenges.”

Students, teachers and parents will participate in the rally, according to the CEA.

The Board of Education was expected to go into executive session Tuesday night for a discussion about "confidential attorney-client privileged communication regarding steps for addressing personnel matters," according to the agenda. They are also expected to discuss an investigation of personnel complaints and take possible action regarding the scope of a climate and culture consultation.

After receiving complaints about the district's leadership, the board voted to hire a climate and culture consultant during a school board meeting in July. Before that, in May, the board voted to extend the superintendent's contract for another year. The board has still not released the superintendent's most recent written evaluation.

The CEA said they want the board to take action against the superintendent.

## Community rallies behind officer fighting to keep Thin Blue Line Flag in Waxhaw neighborhood

WAXHAW, N.C. — A few weeks have passed since a retired New York Police Department officer, living in Waxhaw, was pulled into a fight with his Home Owners Association over his Thin Blue Line flag.

For the past 10 years, Chris Castrogiovanni has flown that flag in honor of his friends and fellow officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

“[After] 9/11, I attended 26 funerals, three of which were personal friends; I have tattooed on my arm,” Castrogiovanni said.

But his HOA has restrictions on flags.

Over the weekend, the community showed their support for Castrogiovanni. Carolina Cruizin 4 Jeeps hosted a ride through the Millbridge Community, where they also delivered wooden door wreaths to families to replace their flags.

## Protest Planned in Monterey Park To Condemn Gun Violence

153 SHARES Share

January 25, at 6:30 pm, in front of Star Dance Studio, 122 West Garvey Avenue.

By News Desk

Guns are the problem – “thoughts and prayers” are not the answer. That’s the slogan members of the SGV Progressive Alliance and SGV Neighbors for Peace and Justice are using to call for a candlelight vigil organized by Compassion in SGV to express solidarity with those that died or were injured at the Monterey Park massacre, and to condemn guns.

Organizers are calling on all elected officials to publicly address the principal cause of this tragedy and that of all mass shootings: guns.

The groups noted that In the past few days, there have been numerous press conferences, public statements, and vigils, and there has been virtually no talk about guns or gun violence, although it is the number one reason this massacre and countless others have happened, and will continue to happen. According to a statement received by our newsroom.

The statement by the three organizations planning the demonstration concluded with the following:

We are deeply disappointed in our elected officials. Universal background checks are not enough. Mental health treatment is not enough. The problem is guns.

Demonstration to Condemn Gun Violence Jan. 25, 2023 6:30pm Location Star Dance Studio 122 W. Garvey Ave, #B (Site of the January 21 Monterey Park massacre)

## SF Chronicle writers walk off the job in ‘lunch-out’

Instead of reporting and editing, San Francisco Chronicle and SFGate staffers will be picketing outside the newspaper’s Fifth and Mission streets building at noon today, pushing the newspaper’s management to sign a union contract after negotiations have stalled.

Nearly two years into negotiations between the San Francisco Chronicle Guild and Hearst, and after dozens of bargaining sessions, the guild now feels that it is on the verge of failing to address three issues that “are just too important” to go unaddressed in their contract: stagnant wages, unequal parental leave and an arbitration clause that allows the company to take “creative interpretations of the contract.”

That’s according to Dustin Gardiner, state capitol reporter and a main organizer of the walkout, the first action the guild has taken in a bid to gain more leverage in its negotiations.

“We’re hopeful that we’re close to a final agreement. But we really can’t settle on these three things,” said Gardiner. “And they’re not willing to move closer to us on those so far.”

Gardiner said the problem was already causing harm to the newsroom: Experienced and mid-career reporters at the paper have left for greener pastures, he said, seeking higher pay and better benefits.

“They’re just not understanding that we have a revolving-door problem with so many experienced people leaving,” he said. “That’s why our members feel so strongly that we need to do something to make them understand that we’re serious about this.”

The guild’s next bargaining session with management is Wednesday, May 24, 2023. The group represents workers at both the San Francisco Chronicle and SFGate.

Chronicle management declined to comment on today’s action.

## Dozens gather in Warren to protest charges against former President Donald Trump

WARREN, Mich. (WXYZ) — Around Michigan Tuesday, there were several demonstrations to show support for former President Donald Trump as he faced indictment. During the hearing in New York, several dozen people gathered outside Warren City Hall in Michigan to protest the charges.

Supporters of Trump sent their message in Warren by beating drums, displaying the Trump Unity Bridge and waving banners or flags.

Recent Stories from wxyz.com

“America is upside down right now. That is all I can really say,” said Alora O’Neil, a Trump supporter who demonstrated by waving an upside down American flag.

“I think this is literally trumped-up charges and this I going to go no where,” said John Vermeulen, a Shelby Township trustee at the protest.

Related: Trump charged with 34 felony counts in hush money scheme

“Trump is going to get our prayers. His family and our goodwill is going to support President Trump,” said Fred Nienstedt, a Trump supporter at the protest.

Away from the protest, the reaction is wide. Many people simply do not want to talk — especially on camera — about politics or Trump. Those willing to talk share a range of emotions from anger, to patience for the process to reveal the facts, to celebration.

“I am happy. He deserves everything he gets. He has been totally wrong. The worst president ever,” Lorenzo Harris said.

“I am happy it has finally come down to it and hopefully, he gets exactly what he deserves,” Letrece Wilbourne said.

## Paterson parents, students protest school district’s ‘right-sizing’ policy to address teacher shortage

A group of parents and their children gathered to demonstrate outside of the Paterson Board of Education building on Friday. They were there in protest of a new policy adopted by the district known as “right-sizing.”

District officials say right sizing is a necessary response to a teacher shortage in Paterson, one that would see some teachers and staff transferring to other schools plus the implementation of larger class sizes. It’s also being done to ensure there’s a certified teacher in each classroom, officials say.

But some parents are skeptical. They say they are worried about overcrowding in classrooms.

Jessica Quevedo has two children in the district - one at STEAM High School and another at Public School 26. She says she fears relationships are being broken up between teachers, students and parents.

“The district did not consult with parents. This was a sneaky move,” Quevedo says.

She says the vice principal at P.S. 26 was the only Spanish-speaking administrator. But that vice principal was recently moved to another school, leaving non-English speaking parents in a lurch.

“There are parents over there who can’t communicate. They go to pick up their kids and have no idea what’s going on there’s no one to talk with us,” Quevedo says.

The teacher shortage is an issue schools all across the country are dealing with. News 12 is told that there are 100 openings for teachers in the Paterson School District....

## Charlesgate caregivers to march to State House to protest shutdown

Charlesgate caregivers to march to State House to protest shutdown

This is photo of a Charlesgate Nursing Center sign. (WLNE)

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — Caregivers at Charlesgate Nursing Center in Providence, who are members of SEIU 1199NE, will hold a rally and march on May 16 to demand Gov. Dan McKee put the facility in receivership.

The caregivers will hold a rally in front of the nursing home at 3 p.m. before marching to the State House.

The facility cited staffing shortages and decreased state funding as the reason for shutting down after 50 years.

“We recognize the challenges that this decision may cause, but there was no other option due to current industry conditions,” said Neil Shunney, president of Davenport Associates.

The union said that Charlesgate announced to workers on April 28 its plan to close the facility in July, despite not receiving approval from the Department of Health.

Caregivers have faced uncertainty since the announcement of the shutdown, with management failing to provide any additional details on its transition plan for residents or severance pay for workers, they added....

## Tenants protest bugs, mold, leaking sewage and no hot water at Cedar Run Apartments

Residents have struggled to get the property managers’ attention. So far, it hasn’t worked.

Tenants at the Cedar Run Apartments picketed in front of the 384-unit South Denver complex on Friday night to bring attention to the broken pipes, leaks, cold water and bugs the renters say management isn’t addressing.

And when renters call to complain, they say, the leasing office doesn’t call back and doesn’t respond to maintenance requests.

“There’s an emergency line. It doesn’t matter how many times you call it. There’s no answer,” said renter Meg Horvath. “There’s no return, checkup, anything. I mean, I got ghosted for like three or four months from these people, while multiple emergencies happened.”

We called to ask management what was going on. No response.

The apartment complex is owned by the Los Angeles-based company Gelt, which bought it in 2019.

The cost? $62 million, reported CoStar.

According to the company’s website, it controls a $1.6 billion portfolio.

Here’s how Gelt describes its mission:

Gelt Inc. strategically invests in multifamily communities in the Western United States that provide residents with a high quality of life through a strong sense of community and abundance of amenities. Through these investment vehicles, we provide our investors with significant cash on cash returns, while also preserving and enhancing their equity over the long term. We invest with confidence in communities that are fulfilling for our residents, and strategic for our investors.

Gelt did not respond to requests for comment on the tenants’ complaints.

Tenants say conditions are not just low quality — they’re neither safe nor healthy.

Warren Bartelme moved into the complex in August.

“It’s been nonstop problems ever since,” he said. “We’ve got veterans, disabled folks, the elderly. We have vulnerable people living in this place. And it’s just disgusting that they want to charge us almost $2,000 a month for a two-bedroom when people are living in f...

## Students hold sit-in at University of Texas board meeting

By Jake Holtzman

Austin, TX – On Thursday, August 24, a group of around 13 students, workers and other members of the University of Texas (UT) community held a sit-in at the UT System Board of Regents fall semester meeting. The protesters were demanding that the board defend diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which have been under threat at public universities since the passing of Texas Senate Bill 17 in May.

Those leading the sit-in are members of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Texas Students for DEI, and the Texas State Employees Union (TSEU).

Although the Board of Regents posted an agenda with an hour-long open session including time for public testimonies, the board rushed through this open session in just 12 minutes, quickly passing the motion to uphold the ban on diversity programs without any objection. They then proceeded to hold the bulk of the meeting behind closed doors.

This did not stop the protesters, however, who marched outside to hold a rally in the lobby where all the university presidents and upper administrators were talking and eating.

SDS member Ashley Awad said, “It is wild to see all of these administrators – who are supposed to listen to and protect the rights of students – ignoring our message and doing nothing to speak up against the ban on diversity programs.”

When asked if anyone would speak up in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the university administrators looked down at their phones and stayed silent. The group of protesters began chanting, “Your silence is compliance, your silence is compliance” and “When DEI is under attack, what do we do? Stand up fight back!”

After the Board of Regents let people back inside for the end of the meeting, protesters confronted Board Chairman Kevin P. Eltife and UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. When asked why they have not acted in defense of diversity programs, both claimed they support “these issues” and walked away declining to give further comment.

## Protest planned against Norfolk Southern’s local cleanup efforts

LISBON, Ohio (WKBN) – This Saturday in Lisbon, a protest will be held against Norfolk Southern.

Organizers say they are hoping to call attention to the train derailment in East Palestine and its cleanup.

Speakers will include local residents, leaders from local advocacy groups and advocates for railway worker safety.

They’ll touch on many topics including relocation expenses, expanding testing and wildlife health concerns. Animals can get sick from drinking from contaminated water sources.

“Try to draw some attention to the impact on our wildlife. A lot of people depend on deer for food,” said protest organizer Zach Baker.

That protest will be at the gazebo on the corner of Market Street and Route 30 in Lisbon starting at 1 p.m....

## Bradley faculty, students stage walkout in protest of proposed academic cuts

With Bradley University looking at sweeping academic cuts to close a $13 million operational deficit, students and faculty members gathered on campus Tuesday to voice their disapproval.

Bradley University president Stephen Standifird last week proposed the discontinuation of 17 programs, and scaling back another five as part of a larger cost-cutting initiative aimed at closing the financial gap.

Standifird says the cutbacks would impact 47 current faculty positions, and an additional 21 would be eliminated through attrition.

But the proposal has proven extremely controversial among the campus community, with many questioning both the urgency and the magnitude of what’s being proposed.

Roughly 200 students and faculty attended Tuesday’s unprecedented walkout, with many students directly leaving a class to attend. Multiple students said that their professors had either canceled classes or openly encouraged them to walk out of class themselves.

The four-hour gathering in Founders’ Circle near the statue of Lydia Moss Bradley started at 10 a.m., with attendees carrying signs with messages including: “Don’t Cut My Future,” “Save Our Education,” and “Lydia’s Vision Is Lost.”

Among the chalk writings on the circle pavement was a plea to “Protect the Teachers + Staff.” At one point, the group chanted, “My tuition, my choice!”

Joe Deacon / WCBU The proposed cuts would impact 47 current faculty positions, and an additional 21 would be eliminated through attrition.

While several faculty members at the rally declined to speak to reporters, others said the impact of the proposed cuts would be severe. Valerie San Juan, a faculty member in the department of psychology, disputed Standifird’s claim the cuts would only impact 3.5% of students.

“Clearly, this rally is demonstrating that that’s not the case,” San Juan said. “It’s also showing the solidarity of the Bradley community, so when things like this impact a small proportion of us, it ultimately impacts all of us.”

## Addison County shows its support for LGBTQ+ community in Middlebury

Middlebury, VT– Addison County‘s second annual Pride Parade on Sunday was a celebration of belonging, love, and community.

The parade, from College Park to the Town Green in Middlebury, was a chance for the commumity to show its support for LGBTQ+ people.

“There are people who care about me who I will never meet, and who will always want me safe,” said Evva Dicovitsky, noting the support they felt at the event.

Elio Farley, the event organizer, said celebrating pride in a rural community is important.

“Specifically for our kids, they’re experiencing a lot of discrimination and bullying at school because of their sexual and gender identity, and because of that they feel really under supported by our community,” said Farley. “When we have such a big show like this, like a giant pride celebration in the middle of Middlebury, Vermont – this little place in rural Vermont – then that helps them feel so much less alone,” they added.

Middlebury’s Teen Center helped organize the event. It’s a space where teens can access resources and programs that promote well-being.

With 25 vendors, and more organizations and regular citizens marching in the parade, there was something for everyone! Food trucks, merchandise, cupcakes, games, and live music could be found in the center of town.

“I was expecting maybe like 20 people, but there’s so many people here! And there’s so much awesome stuff like the rainbow arch, it’s awesome,” exclaimed Dicovitsky.

Farley added that the event was largely geared toward queer youth.

“Being queer is a very large part of my identity, and I like to support my other queer friends, and family members, and just anybody who’s queer in any way I possibly can,” said Nova Bojanowski.

“It’s hard to be a gay person, especially with all of the laws trying to erase us from schools, or erase us from public spaces,” noted Farley. “Being able to gather and celebrate and show such a wide outpouring of support just makes all the difference,” they said.

## Over 250 people attend Marshall County’s first drag show despite months of backlash

ALBERTVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - After months of messages, opposition from pastors and threats of protests, Albertville’s first drag show happened on Friday night.

Performer Meagan Flosha believes this is a turning point for the Marshall County community.

“I don’t think Marshall County ever thought they would have an event like this in anybody’s lifetime, especially mine,” Flosha said.

Since it’s announcement, the Holly Jolly Drag Show faced controversy. Yet, Albertville Police were on scene at the Crossroads Mall deterring protestors at the request of the property owners.

Chief J.T. Cartee says safety for everyone was the number one priority and offered another avenue on how to express their concerns.

“Don’t get mad. Pray. I’ve talked to some of the people involved in organizing the protests and they have agreed that it’d be better to hold prayer vigils at their church. Why don’t you join in and pray with them? Prayer is far more powerful than protest,” Cartee said.

Organizer and owner of Baked and Boozy LLC. Jessica Turner expressed her gratitude to the police department for ensuring everyone’s safety.

“It gives me a sense of security knowing we have their presence here,” Turner said.

Three people did attempt to protest on the property but were quickly asked to leave by on-site law enforcement. Turner says the event has marched on despite the adversity.

“We’ve had so many people say ‘we’re gonna do a spiritual war. We don’t want a war, we don’t want a fight. We just want everybody to be peaceful and love each other. It’s just that simple,” Turner said.

Turner says all proceeds will go toward Magic City Acceptance Academy in Homewood, Alabama to support LGBTQ children.

## Aspen Women's March 2023 Bigger Than Roe

Our 2023 Annual Women’s March is coming!

This year’s national theme is “Bigger Than Roe” because the problems posed by policies put in place by the previous administration, and of course the overturning of Roe itself, resonate in a myriad of ways in the lives of people in so many overlapping categories.

Come join us in any or all of the parts of our day:

—Gather (with family-friendly signs, if you wish) at the Gondola Plaza @ Durant and Hunter at 11:30 promptly.

—March together at 11:45 to the Paepcke Park Gazebo on Main

— Speakers begin their topical speeches at exactly 12noon.

— No later than 1pm — probably closer to 12:45–march with us through the town with our signs, ending at the fountain outside the Wheeler Opera House. Join us! Your voice is your vote!

On January 22, 2023, the anniversary of Roe V Wade, as we mourn the loss of nearly 50 years of constitutional protections, we send another clear message:

The midterms were just the beginning. We are not going gently. We are taking our fight to every state and every legislator in this country. Our movement is strong. Our movement is growing.

Our movement is Bigger than Roe....

## Protesters opposed to Florida abortion ban march to Fort Lauderdale City Hall - WSVN 7News

FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - Protesters came together in downtown Fort Lauderdale to take part in a rally for reproductive rights.

Demonstrators representing several nonprofit organizations marched to City Hall along North Andrews Avenue on Saturday afternoon with their message against abortion restrictions.

Protesters said they want the issue on the 2024 ballot.

“It’s about women having control over their own body. That’s the bottom line,” said protester Leslie Sheffield. “This is human rights, reproductive rights; this isn’t right or wrong. This is civil rights.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a six-week ban on abortion with few exceptions in a private ceremony held April 13.

The law is set to go into effect if the state’s current 15-week-ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge.

## Vigils to be held at local synagogue, on University of Missouri campus

COLUMBIA, Mo. (KMIZ)

On Thursday, Congregation Beth Shalom will hold a vigil at 7 p.m. to pray for Israel as a war continues to rage throughout the country.

And a University of Missouri student group will hold its own vigil on campus in support of Palestinians.

The vigil will be at 7 p.m at the congregation located at 500 Green Meadows Rd. and all are welcome to attend.

Prayers for remembrance and peace for Israel will be recited at the vigil.

The Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine will also hold a vigil, this one at 5:30 p.m. at Speakers Circle on the University of Missouri campus.

Congregation Beth Shalom says they are increasing security at the synagogue ahead of the vigil as the Israel-Hamas war continues.

Even though Israel is over 6,500 miles away from Missouri, people locally and statewide are seeing the effects of the war.

On October 7th, Missouri House Speaker Dean Plocher and Senate President Caleb Rowden released a joint statement stating their unwavering support for Israel during this time of war.

"We reiterate our unwavering support for the State of Israel and its inherent right to defend itself against acts of terrorism and aggression. The terrorists and terrorist regimes that planned and are carrying out these unprovoked and vicious acts of violence deserve swift justice at the hands of Israel and her allies, including the United States of America," the statement reads.

Gov. Mike Parson also took to "X," formerly known as Twitter saying he, and the state of Missouri stand with Israel, and that the United States must as well.

On Monday, information was released that Boone County native Deborah Matias, who was living in Israel died while trying to shield her son from Hamas gunfire. The son is expected to recover.

On Wednesday, ABC 17 News reported that several members of a church in Moberly are stuck in Israel due to flights being cancelled because of the war. The Iowa church group they were traveling with says they have all made it ou...

## Heated exchanges between Palestinian, Israeli protesters in downtown Nashville

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — As the Israel-Hamas war intensifies one week after the initial attacks, pro-Israel and pro-Palestine protesters gathered in downtown Nashville in what became a heated debate.

The protest on Saturday, Oct. 14 started with roughly a dozen protesters supporting the Palestinians, but it quickly grew into several hundred. Several people supporting the Israelis also showed up to counter-protest, sharing heartbreaking stories of relatives currently overseas among the violence.

“This is supposed to be a retaliation against propaganda and against media trying to play this narrative that all of this started October 10th, and trying to ignore all the context related to the 75-plus years of not only occupation, but ethnic cleansing and genocide,” explained Fatehiya, who helped organize the pro-Palestine protest.

From the other side of the Federal Building entrance in downtown Nashville, Tomer Minuskin, among other pro-Israel protesters, described gruesome details of violence from the Hamas attacks.

“On the seventh of this month, Israel was attacked by a bunch of monsters. They butchered kids, babies, mothers, and the elderly,” Minuskin said. “Both my parents, my mother and my father have been in shelters since the seventh of this month. They cannot leave their houses because we still have terrorists that are outside and trying to hunt Israelis.”

The pro-Palestine protest organizers spoke with News 2 about their feelings on Hamas, which they emphasized was a militant group independent from their government.

“Palestine does not have much power, generally, and if they had to turn to someone, even if they don’t have to agree with everything that they say, Hamas maybe doing these things, but they’re helping a resistance, and they’re the only person, they’re the only military group with the manpower to do so,” Fatehiya told News 2.

Tensions grew throughout downtown. Meanwhile, members of the Metro Nashville Police Department continued to pivot as prot...

L.B., a transgender girl, had already picked out a dress and a pair of heeled shoes to wear under her traditional cap and gown.

Earlier this month, however, she said she and her parents were informed by Harrison Central principal Kelly Fuller that she could not attend the ceremony because her outfit violated the school's male dress code, which requires that boys wear black suits.

"I had dreamed of walking across the stage in my beautiful white dress that I purchased months ago in preparation for this event," L.B. said during a speech Monday afternoon in Washington, D.C. "This is very humiliating, discouraging and disappointing to hear."

The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Mississippi have since filed a lawsuit against Harrison Central School District on L.B.'s behalf. But a federal judge denied L.B.'s request to wear a dress at her graduation in a late Friday night ruling after an hours-long emergency injunction hearing.

Harrison Central School District did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

## California 2024 US Senate contest kicks off at furious pace

LOS ANGELES — California's U.S. Senate race is unfolding at a furious pace, with candidates reporting seven-figure fundraising and holding competing rallies and campaign events more than a year before the 2024 primary election.

The fight for the safely Democratic seat held by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who at 89 is the oldest member of Congress, is shaping up as a marquee match-up between nationally known rivals and is likely to become one of the most expensive Senate races in the country next year.

On Saturday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, who rose to prominence as the lead prosecutor in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial, gathered hundreds of supporters in a union hall parking lot for a rally in his hometown of Burbank, California, where he implored the cheering crowd, "Let's go win this thing."

Schiff, who announced his candidacy last month, said he was running for Senate after two decades in Congress "to build an economy that works for everyone, a democracy that will last for all time and a planet that doesn't melt beneath our feet."

A day earlier, Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter brought her Senate campaign to Los Angeles, where she met with local leaders to discuss pollution in lower-income neighborhoods. She said such areas are often overlooked in Washington and Sacramento, where residents' complaints about unhealthy conditions go unheard.

Porter, a leader in Congress' progressive wing, built a reputation for her tough questioning of CEOs and other witnesses at congressional hearings — often using a whiteboard to break down information.

Other potential contenders for the seat include Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. If she runs and is elected, Lee would be the only Black woman in the Senate.

Feinstein has yet to say if she will seek a seventh term. In recent years, questions have arisen about her cognitive health and memory, though she has defended her effectiveness. However, her reti...

## Iowa immigration advocates protest four bills they say would create barriers for legal residents

Vanessa Marcano-Kelly speaks Feb. 7, 2024 at a rally organized by Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice at the Iowa Capitol. — Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch

Some of the Republican-proposed bills taking aim at undocumented immigration this legislative session would also make it harder for naturalized citizens and other legal residents to live and work in Iowa, members of a migrant advocacy group said Wednesday.

Members of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice rallied in the Capitol rotunda against four bills that speakers said target immigrants:

SF 108 would require employers to use a federal system called E-Verify to check the immigration status of job applicants.

Vanessa Marcano-Kelly, chair of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice board, shared concerns as a naturalized citizen and small business owner about the E-Verify system.

“It’s really burdensome, it’s really inefficient. It takes a really long time. And it actually could keep out people who have documents to work, who have authorization to work,” she said.

“So for example, like, I have been a citizen since 2019. And so if that system hasn’t been properly updated, I could come up as a temporary non-confirmation even though I’m literally a citizen now,” she said.

She said the legislation is an ineffective solution in search of a problem, “and the problem is, we don’t have enough workers.”

Backers of the legislation dispute the claim that the system is ineffective.

HF 2112, which would expand the definition of human smuggling and also address background checks for public assistance.

Luis Gomez, who spoke at the rally, said he relied on his community for assistance during the 10 years he was undocumented before gaining legal status. He couldn’t drive, for example, so neighbors would give him rides. He said if the bill became law, driving an undocumented person to the doctor or to school could put someone at risk of a felony smuggling charge.

The bill includes an element of criminal intent, such...

## Hundreds rally at Capitol for clean energy plans centered on Indigenous rights

Hundreds of people rallied at the Capitol rotunda in St. Paul on Wednesday to demand that clean-energy plans in the state center Indigenous communities and work to right the wrongs of the past.

The rally was organized by more than 20 Indigenous, faith and environmental advocacy groups in response to the state’s new clean-energy law. Last week, Gov. Tim Walz signed a law mandating Minnesota’s electricity utilities become 100 percent carbon-free by 2040.

Now the question is how to implement a greener future. The groups at the rally said the 2040 goal lays a critical foundation for a more sustainable economy, but their focus was advocating for the transition to be centered on environmental justice for Indigenous communities, who are more vulnerable to climate change, like water-related and respiratory illnesses, mental health effects and food system impacts, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“There will be a transition,” said Ashley Fairbanks, a member of White Earth Nation in northern Minnesota and creative director of 100% Campaign. “But it is up to us to ensure that this transition is just, that it happens in a way that honors Indigenous rights and sovereignty, repairs harm and includes every single Minnesotan.”

"The coalition of advocacy groups, including Minnesota Interfaith Power & Light and Honor the Earth, came together under the slogan “Rise and Repair.”

Fairbanks, a rally organizer, said rise and repair means “rise up for Indigenous rights and repairing past harms, or reparations for people who are descendants of chattel slavery, and honoring Indigenous treaty rights.”

## ‘Plain old greed:’ HCA nurses rally to denounce understaffing, unsafe conditions at hospitals

Judy Preuss, an ICU nurse at HCA Florida Oak Hill Hospital, joined the National Nurses Organizing Committee 13 years ago for the same reason she rallied Thursday afternoon in Tampa with colleagues from other parts of the country: Bargaining to fix understaffing.

Oak Hill Hospital, where Preuss has worked for 18 years, is one of HCA Healthcare’s 46 hospitals in Florida. The nurses from the union representing 10,000 registered nurses across the U.S. held a rally at the HCA West Florida Division Office in Tampa. There, they held signs with the phrase, “Hey HCA, put patients over profit.”

The contract for the union expires next year.

“Pretty much every nurse will tell you the same thing: The staffing is the main reason. We just all want to take care of our patients the way that we would want our mother to be taken care of or ourselves to be taken care of,” Pruess told the Florida Phoenix. “We want them to get the proper care. We don’t want to put profits over patients, and there’s nothing wrong with profits. I mean, we’re in a capitalistic society, we all need to make money, but it’s pure greed.

“There’s profit and then there’s just plain old greed and that’s what’s come up in the corporations now that own the hospitals.”

The health care provider, which owns 184 hospitals nationwide reported $16.2 billion in revenues during the third quarter in October. Also this year, state officials and politicians have inquired about unsafe practices at HCA hospitals in Florida and North Carolina.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services opened an investigation earlier this month into the operations of the emergency department at Mission Hospital in Asheville, which is an HCA hospital. One of the nurses who works there, Hannah Drummond, attended Thursday’s rally in Tampa.

“The minute all these folks entered town all of a sudden, magically, staff got much, much better,” Drummond said in an interview with the Phoenix. She has worked at the hospital in Asheville...

## Supporters rally to support Ken Paxton after being impeached by the Texas House

Ken Paxton supporters rally after his impeachment by the Texas House

Supporters of the now impeached Texas Attorney General rallied in his home county in North Texas today and they're not happy with their own Republican representatives who voted to impeach.

Outside the Collin County Courthouse, more than 200 people came to protest the impeachment of Ken Paxton. Some admitted they don't know if Paxton is guilty or not of the 20 charges laid out against him.

"He's the only AG that I'm aware of that has fought back on the Biden administration and sued the Biden administration," said Paxton supporter Gary Cable.

Speakers attacked, instead, what they see as a rushed impeachment and lack of due process. Plano City Council Member Shelby Williams was one of those who criticized the process.

"As much as we need to hold our elected officials accountable, we need to hold the process even more accountable," Shelby said.

More than 4/5ths of the Republican-controlled House voted Saturday to impeach Paxton, including all 5 representatives from Collin County, a fact that didn't go over well with today's crowd.

In a joint statement Saturday, the five Republicans wrote that it was "an incredibly difficult vote" but that "sufficient evidence indeed exists" to impeach

GOP county chair Abraham George says now it's time to focus on the Senate - urging those in attendance to call for a fair trial, but a quick one, too.

"Obviously you saw today that Collin County representatives made a mistake by doing that," said George. "It's not that they voted to impeach him but that they supported this process."...

## ‘She was a loving person’: Friends, family remember woman hit & killed by car in Wyoming

WYOMING, Mich. — Family and friends gathered Saturday to remember Sharika Williams. She was killed in a traffic accident early Thursday morning.

“She was a loving person. Everybody that come in contact with her said she's a person that don't judge,” says cousin Kanesha Graves. “She loves heart. She will give you the shirt off our back, anything.”

They say the 32-year-old Wyoming woman was hit and killed while crossing Chicago Drive.

Now, those loved ones are hoping to prevent the tragedy from happening to anyone else.

Recent Stories from fox17online.com

“She was crossing the street to catch the bus the same as you do every day,” says Kanesha. “We just need the community support and try to see exactly what's going on with this corner. Because it's been a lot of fatal accidents at this corner. And the speed in over here is terrible.”

Guests at the vigil are pleading for drivers in the area to slow down, and calling on the community for support.

“She was not my child. But I raised her as my child. So it's like … I lost my child today,” adds Kanesha. “Now I got to raise her kids, and we got to do the best we can for her kids. That's all we can do.”

If you'd like to help, the family has created a GoFundMe page.

Hundreds march in Highland Park on July 4th to heal, create a new tradition

HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (CBS) – More than 2,200 people came together in Highland Park for a community walk to mark one year since the Fourth of July parade shooting that irrevocably changed thousands of lives.

The participants marched the same route as last year's parade, letting the community reclaim it, and move forward in a way that will give them a chance to experience the Fourth of July again in the future.

That march ended with a picnic in Sunset Woods Park. CBS 2's Tara Molina spent the holiday with the crowd and heard from city leaders who spoke about the importance of taking the community back and moving forward.

A community effort led to the march this Fourth of July with hundreds joining to create new traditions and celebrate together.

There was live music, burgers on the grill, and the sun shining on Sunset Woods Park.

"I think it shows the power of positive living and the power of positive thinking," said Dan Mendelson.

It's where Highland Park held its picnic this holiday.

"I came to pay my respect for the people of Highland Park," said Suzanne Bening.

Saul Deyja added, "Our community is healing. It's great to be out here."

Once again, they came together to move forward together as a community.

"We are here and life goes on and certainly it's positive that people can end that part of it and kind of bring everybody into a new, not beginning, but evolving from that into something positive," said Mark Walton.

This is perhaps a new tradition.

"Being here today means that we're alive," said Talia Raab. "We survived. Our community was not broken."

A community walk of hundreds ended at the park where the Fourth of July family fun kicked off, a celebration that's Highland Park strong.

## Over 1,000 Little Rock Central High students walk out to protest LEARNS bill

Over 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School walked out in protest of Gov. Sarah Sanders’ LEARNS Act on Friday.

This comes after students released a letter to the governor about her invocation of Central High history in her speeches and legislation. Over 1,500 students, alumni, parents and staff have signed the letter, which takes a stance against the bill.

“By siphoning funds and resources away from public education and into the private sector, the ambition of our disadvantaged students and hardworking faculty will be stifled,” the letter stated.

“Governor Sanders’ intent to imitate policies similar to those of Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality.”

“School choice policies which will favor upper-class families would create unequal opportunities for lower-income students.”

## Council decision sparks Eastpointe Pride protest

On the 54th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising Wednesday evening, more than 60 people gathered in front of Eastpointe City Hall waving rainbow flags to protest the city council’s decision not to support a resolution recognizing June as Pride month.

The 1969 Stonewall Uprising started when New York police raided a gay bar in Greenwich Village and patrons and members of the community fought back. The spontaneous protests lasted for six days and the event is recognized as a huge step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.

Eastpointe was the first city in Macomb County to recognize Pride month in 2019; this is the first year since then City Council has not approved a Pride resolution.

“The fact that they did not approve it this year is very awkward,” said Eastpointe resident Nick Gevedon. “We want to show there are people in Eastpointe who do want a Pride resolution.

“One of the council members mentioned that he has gay friends that do not want a Pride resolution and we are just here to show him there are lots of people that do.”

Many who attended the event had signs and rainbow flags of varying sizes and several motorists on Gratiot Avenue honked horns and waved in support of the protesters.

“I was born here, I went to school here, I own my home here,” said Eastpointe resident Trevor Walters, 32. “They say the reason they voted no on this was to remain neutral, as if the status quo wasn’t exclusion and repression before for gays and queers and transsexual people.”

“I don’t think it is on the right side of history and I hope that the mayor and those that voted no on this will reconsider.”

Councilman Cardi DeMonaco Jr., who introduced the Pride resolution at the May 16 Eastpointe City Council meeting, spoke during Wednesday’s protest. He and Harvey Curley voted in favor of the resolution; Stacy Cobb-Muniz and Rob Baker voted against it. Mayor Monique Owens was absent from that meeting but has voted against Pride resolutions in the past.

“The simple thing that we were try...

## East Cobb synagogue target of Nazi flags, anti-Semitic signs

A small handful of people stood in front of the Chabad of Cobb synagogue in East Cobb on Saturday, waving Nazi swastika flags and holding up signs with anti-Semitic messages.

A Facebook user named Tamara Stevens was collecting photos, videos and other information from passers-by as the incident unfolded late Saturday afternoon and into early Saturday evening.

This appears to be the second protest in recent days in Georgia by a group calling itself the Goyim Defense League, which conducted a similar event at a Macon synagogue.

Chabad of Cobb is located on Lower Roswell Road, next to the East Cobb Government Services Center and across from Mt. Bethel Church and a branch of the U.S. Postal Office.

Police officers were on either side of the road and directing traffic. A group of counter-protestors across the road shot videos and yelled, shouting at the pro-Nazi group to “go home!” and threatening to tell their employers.

But the pro-Nazi protestors were undeterred, and made gestures in return.

Their signs said “Every Single Aspect of [a particular topic] is Jewish,” with the topics including abortion, the media, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and elected officials.

At the bottom of the signs was a Web address to the Goyim group’s YouTube page, with videos including a program called “Saturday White Live.”

One of those shooting videos confronted the protestors directly, including a man holding up a sign saying “Every Single Aspect of Abortion is Jewish,” and called him “an idiot.”

He retorted that “we shouldn’t lie to our children” as he shot a selfie video of himself.

She later went up to a protestor holding a sign saying “Every Aspect of the Federal Reserve” is Jewish. It included photos of past chairs, with the Star of David marked on the foreheads of some of them.

“You’re a Nazi and you’re an idiot,” she told him.

Another protestor held a sign vilifying the Anti-Defamation League, saying it was established to “Protect a Jewish Child Murdering Pedophile Leo ...

## NY home care workers protest 'rampant' wage theft after labor dept. drops investigation

Home health aides will rally outside the state Department of Labor’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan at 11 a.m. on Wednesday to protest the agency’s decision to stop investigating their complaints of wage theft. It’s an issue that New York home care workers said is rampant, particularly when they work 24-hour shifts, and they have been sounding the alarm about the problem for years. The demonstration comes after five home care workers filed a petition in state Supreme Court last week to get the labor department to reopen its investigations into their wage theft complaints, which they recently learned had been closed. The group of workers argue their complaints are representative of labor abuses throughout the industry and are seeking class-action status. All of the complaints are related to home health aides allegedly being underpaid while working around the clock in their elderly or disabled clients’ homes. State policy allows these workers to be paid for just 13 hours of a 24-hour shift, as long as they also receive sufficient time for sleep and meals. In recent years, home care workers have tried and failed to successfully challenge that rule in court. Many said the home care staffing agencies they work for have also declined to properly compensate them during shifts when they can’t get the requisite sleep and meal time, and some have turned to the Department of Labor to enforce the law. Dozens of workers attested to their underpayment under the 13-hour system during a labor department hearing on the issue in 2018. “As a government agency, the Department of Labor should enforce the law and give us justice,” said Gui Hua Song, a retired home attendant named in the lawsuit against the state, in an emailed statement to Gothamist.

According to the petition, Song routinely had to change one of her clients’ diapers and reposition her throughout the night while working multiple days in a row, but was never compensated for more than 13 hours of each 24-hour shift. In he...

## Montclair High School students walk out to protest teaching job cuts

Montclair students walk out in solidarity with teachers

MONTCLAIR, N.J. - Students in Montclair, New Jersey walked out of classes Thursday to protest cuts to teaching positions.

The students filed out of Montclair High School just after 9 a.m.

The school district cut 31 teacher slots and about 34 paraprofessionals to help balance a $5.5 million budget deficit.

Students say the cuts are mainly affecting four schools.

"These cuts are to schools on the south end. We're talking Glenfield, Nishuane, and Montclair high school. They are cutting a lot of arts," one student said. "Different lunches so our friends can't be together. No study halls anymore. It's just not really fair to the students."

CBS2 has reached out to the school superintendent's office for comment about the walkout but have not heard back....

## ‘Take our community back’ groups rally to fight Birmingham gun violence

This is another installment in Birmingham Times/AL.com joint series “Beyond the Violence: what can be done to address Birmingham’s rising homicide rate.” Sign up for the newsletter here.

Get the newsletter: Enter your email to follow the Beyond the Violence series.

Amid anger, grief, sorrow and tears, gun violence victims’ family members gathered in Birmingham Saturday to honor loved ones taken too soon and to demand action to combat the rash of killings that have plagued the city in recent years.

The Birmingham Urban League hosted a National Gun Violence Awareness Day program Saturday at Kelly Ingram Park, gathering together those who’ve lost family and friends to gun violence with government, law enforcement, and civic groups that are working to fight back against an epidemic of violence.

“We’ve got to come together as a community, separate and apart with any government that oversees us,” Birmingham Urban League CEO William Barnes told the crowd of about 100 people.

Barnes urged attendees to talk about violence within their families and to be more vigilant about situations within their neighborhoods that could spiral into violence.

“Take our community back,” he said.

Several community organizations also participated, including What About Us, a Birmingham-based nonprofit that provides support for those who have lost children.

The group set up a tent displaying photos of those lost to gun violence in recent years.

Founder Sheree Kennon said she started the group after the death of her son Detraio Deshawn Whorton, 27, on Feb. 25, 2021.

“A lot of people hear about the cases, the deaths in the city, but they don’t know the faces,” Kennon said. “They don’t know the mothers, they don’t know what the children have been through. They just see what they hear on the news.

“They are more than just a number. They are our babies.”

Also present was the Birmingham-based Offender Alumni Association, a group that provides support for those impacted by incarceration and ...

## New York students rally for public higher ed investments

Student advocates gathered at the New York State Capitol in Albany to rally behind a New Deal for public higher education in the state.

With an April 1st budget deadline looming, advocates rallied on the Million Dollar Staircase Thursday, calling for a tuition freeze at the state’s public colleges and universities.

“Hey hey, ho ho. Tuition hikes have got to go!”

Governor Kathy Hochul’s 2024 budget proposes big investments for SUNY and CUNY campuses, including $1.5 billion for new capital projects, $270 million in new annual funding for campuses, and a half-billion dollar investment in a matching fund for contributions at SUNY’s four university centers.

But the plan also includes a system-wide tuition increase of 3 percent – 6 percent at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook.

The administration says the increases are needed to ensure SUNY and CUNY schools are able to invest in their futures in a time of rising costs.

Student advocates say the tuition increases are the wrong idea – and are pushing for free tuition for all.

University at Albany student and SUNY Student Assembly Senior Director of Government Relations Joshua Chan said the so-called New Deal for public higher ed is especially important for immigrant families.

“Our immigrant families came here to give us a better life. Through the public education system with SUNY and CUNY, that’s possible. This budget must include free SUNY, free CUNY, higher TAP increases, and a higher Excelsior [Scholarship] increase as well,” said Chan. “Because those are the mechanisms that promote freedom and liberty across New York State.”

New York’s Excelsior Scholarship program covers tuition for qualifying students at SUNY and CUNY schools, but not college-related expenses like room and board – making financial aid still necessary for many.

Ronald Jean-Claude Jr., a Haitian immigrant, spoke about the difficulty he faced in securing financial aid while he was attending community college in Queens.

“I experienced ...

## After Indiana court ruling, protesters rally against abortion law

After Indiana court ruling, protesters rally against abortion law

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The state’s near-total ban on abortion could go into effect on or around Aug. 1 after the Indiana Supreme Court lifted an injunction against it in June.

That decision did not prevent dozens of people from protesting Saturday in front of the Statehouse. Janice Bennett was among them. She remembered what life was like before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled abortion was protected by the Constitution.

“It was a big cause. We were trying to get it legalized, and I remember how hard it was for women, how many women died because they got an illegal abortion.”

Today, she finds herself back in that fight 50 years later and one year after Indiana legislators passed a near-total ban on abortion.

Bennett said, “To me it’s about rights and privacy. My decision is for family, or my life, when it comes to abortion and my health care. That’s my decision.”

Right to Life Indianapolis issued a statement after the Indiana Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect saying in part.

“”This is big victory in the fight to protect the life of unborn babies, and to protect pregnant mothers from the often lifelong trauma of abortion. This case is also a victory in that Indiana was the first state to pass pro-life legislation since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.”

The group All-Options Pregnancy runs an abortion fund that helps Hoosiers get abortions out of state. It said that, from January to June, it funded 1,600 abortions and pledged over $300,000 in support to people who need abortion care.

Jessica Marchbank, state programs director for All-Options, said that number increased dramatically in the months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. “January of 2022, we funded 51 people and we pledged about $11,000 for that whole month. We funded 50 people in two days this week.”

Despite facing an uphill poltical battle, abortion rights supporters are determined to keep this...

## Bigger Than Roe

This is a sign-holding event, so bring protest signs and a flashlight. Women's March urges people to avoid images of slavery, hangers, or the "Handmaid's Tale." (For more explanation email me or check their site). When it gets dark, we will shine flashlights on our signs. Also note: Jeannie Ludlow, Eastern Illinois University English Professor and expert on abortion, will give a short speech on abortion access and rights. Dress warmly but the forecast is for mild weather, 42–33 degrees with a 25-30% chance of rain or snow.

Come fired up and remember that:

We are ALL born free and equal in dignity and rights. The Supreme Court of the U.S. and the United States Congress have failed in their obligation to protect, respect, and uphold our human rights. The women's wave delivered a blow to anti-freedom politicians in the 2022 midterms, and now we are taking the fight out of D.C. and into every single state in this country.

On January 22, 2023, the anniversary of Roe V Wade, as we mourn the loss of nearly 50 years of constitutional protections, we send another clear message:

The midterms were just the beginning. We are not going gently. We are taking our fight to every state house and every state legislator in this country. We are putting all politicians at every level of government on notice: If you come for our families, our freedoms, or our future, we are coming for your seat. Our movement is strong. Our movement is growing.

Our movement is Bigger than Roe....

## Thousands of writers and actors rally in Los Angeles: “Most revolutions occur … when you have nothing left”

Over 3,000 actors, writers and supporters rallied in Los Angeles September 13 in a show of strength against the entertainment companies. Tens of thousands of actors, members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), have been on strike now for two months. Some 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have been on strike for more than four months.

A view of the rally outside Paramount, Los Angeles, California, September 13, 2023.

The large turnout of actors and other workers Wednesday was a testament to the strikers’ enormous determination. There is a deeply felt sense that things cannot carry on in the old way. While Disney, Netflix, Amazon and the other giant entertainment corporations earn billions in profit, actors and writers have seen their wages and conditions deteriorate. The WGA estimates that writers’ incomes have dropped by 23 percent over the past decade, taking inflation into account. The companies are relentlessly pushing ahead with different means, through technology and otherwise, of lowering costs at the expense of the workforce. The future of the writing and acting professions is quite literally on the line.

The determination, however, of the striking workers stands in contrast to the dead-end strategy of the union functionaries in the leadership of SAG-AFTRA and the WGA.

Workers must be warned: no “historic” deal is on its way, behind the empty sloganeering of the union tops, the actual development of events points in a different direction, toward a sellout.

Wednesday’s rally was dominated by the usual chants and loud music. This type of carnival-like atmosphere, presented as a climate of “powerful action” and “solidarity,” actually works to suppress serious discussion and analysis, both of the immediate progress of the strike and its larger political and social implications.

To the extent that union leaders presented a strategy it was focused on the question of “how to change the ...

## Calls for ceasefire in Gaza grow in Mass.; rallies held for both sides Sunday

It has been almost a month since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, prompting Israel to declare war.

Israeli warplanes struck a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, killing at least 40 people and wounding dozens, health officials said. The strike came as Israel said it would press on with its offensive to crush the territory's Hamas rulers, despite U.S. appeals for a pause to get aid to desperate civilians.

The soaring death toll in Gaza has sparked growing international anger, with tens of thousands from Washington to Berlin taking to the streets Saturday to demand an immediate cease-fire.

In Massachusetts, there was a Pro-Palestinian rally in Braintree and a Rally for Israel in Brookline on Sunday.

Organizers within the local Jewish community are calling for unwavering support for Israel, while Palestinians are condemning what they are calling a genocide against their people. Similar to what we've been seeing at these rallies, emotions ran high at both Bay State events.

The local Jewish community is calling for unwavering support for Israel, while Palestinians are condemning what they are calling a genocide against their people.

Those supporting Israel and those supporting Palestinians have both described actions against their own communities as genocidal.

In Brookline, there was music, food and signs flooding Babcock Street on Sunday afternoon for the celebration of Jewish life. The event was also used as a platform to continue a show of support for Israel in its war against Hamas, and it was a fundraiser, too.

“It is our responsibility to make clear to the world that we will not waiver," a woman told the crowd. "Israel has every right to defend itself and to exist as a sovereign homeland of the Jewish people.”

The solidarity walk held throughout Coolidge Corner was in response to the attack nearly one month ago. Some ...

## Protesters disrupt joint session of Mass. Legislature with demands for fossil fuel cuts

Updated May 10 at 8:34 p.m.

Environmental activists disrupted a joint session of the Massachusetts Legislature Wednesday with a protest pushing for a more aggressive state response to climate change.

Just after 11 a.m., as the House and Senate wrapped up the first session of this legislative cycle’s Constitutional Convention without engaging in any deliberation, about a dozen protesters from the groups Extinction Rebellion Boston and Scientist Rebellion rushed to unfurl a banner with the message “No new fossil fuel infrastructure” in the front row of the gallery overlooking the House floor. The banner was quickly pulled away by a court officer.

Members of the group also began reading from a memorandum detailing their demands, which also include halting any fossil fuel infrastructure projects that are currently underway and additional steps aimed at creating what they call a "just transition" to a carbon-free economy.

The protesters remained in the House Gallery after the reading. Susan Lemont, a spokesperson for the activists who was stationed outside the room, said they would only leave if legislation banning new fossil-fuel infrastructure was introduced. At 5 p.m., when the State House officially closed, nine of them were arrested on trespassing charges.

Prior to the protest, one of the organizers, Alex Chambers, said a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure would help the state meet aggressive emissions goals that are already on the books — and that the protest itself was aimed at disrupting a dangerous sense of complacency on the part of state lawmakers.

"Where we're at right now is, there's [a] ten-municipality pilot program that would let local municipalities opt into banning gas hookups for [new] commercial and residential usage," Chambers said. "And we're trying to go a step beyond that ... We want there to be an end date for all of this stuff.

## Jewish Demonstrators Block Bridges in 8 U.S. Cities to Demand Ceasefire in Gaza

“We have to keep being impossible to ignore,” one of the groups organizing the events said.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

On Wednesday evening and into the night, hundreds of demonstrators in eight cities across the U.S. shut down bridges and highways to pressure the Biden administration and members of Congress into demanding a permanent ceasefire in Israel’s genocidal siege of Gaza.

Jewish organizers and their allies gathered in Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Chicago. The coordinated protest effort was organized by leaders from Jewish Voice for Peace, Jewish Fast For Gaza, IfNotNow and other groups to take place on the eighth day of Hanukkah, a deeply symbolic decision.

The groups documented protesters’ actions through several social media posts.

Paul Goyette

“Tonight hundreds of Jews + allies shut down the biggest intersection in downtown Boston for all of rush hour,” said a post on X from IfNotNow. “Until the U.S. government follows the will of the people and calls for a ceasefire, we have to keep being impossible to ignore. It’s life and death.”

“The Twin Cities have joined the nation-wide call from U.S. Jews for a permanent ceasefire and full Palestinian freedom!” Jewish Voice for Peace said on its social media, publishing images of the protest on the Franklin Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis.

Activists in Portland blocked traffic on the Burnside Bridge, using a giant menorah “to rekindle their commitment to a liberated Palestine,” Jewish Voice for Peace wrote in another post.

“On the last day of Hanukkah, we are rising up to say: CEASEFIRE NOW, Palestinians should be free,” Jewish Voice for Peace-Atlanta said, posting images of their protest on the Jackson Street Bridge.

## Students rally at state Capitol for gun reform after another school shooting

DENVER — One day after two faculty members at East High School were shot and injured by a student, hundreds of Denver Public Schools students went to the Colorado State Capitol to call for gun reform.

Students from East High School flooded the hallways, House and Senate galleries — even some lawmakers’ offices — to speak to any legislator who would listen about the changes they would like to see.

Recent Stories from denver7.com

“We have to be here because we don't want this to happen again. You don't want to have to take time out of our school just to not be scared and horrified of what just happened to us,” said Beckett Nelson Gardner, a student from East High.

Some students said they want to see the passage of a package of gun reform bills that's currently making its way through the legislature. Others called for the approval of a ban on assault weapons, which faces an uncertain future in the legislature.

“I think it's really unfair that students have to be afraid to go to school, and they have to sort of live in like a fear that, like, something may happen,” said Sean Burtchaell, a senior from George Washington High School. “We're no longer so young that we can be ignored, and I think we need to make our voices heard.”

A few students called for laws to go even further, telling lawmakers they want the minimum age for purchasing a firearm to be raised to 25.

After speaking with legislators, students then went outside for a rally, speaking about their experiences and fears for their future. Back inside the Capitol, Democratic lawmakers are preparing to introduce a bill next week that would ban ghost guns in the state.

“I think it has a direct relationship to what happened in East is that it's one of the ways that students are getting guns is these untraceable firearms. Many of them you can order through mail order kits,” said Sen. Chris Hansen, D-Denver.

Ghost guns do not have a serial number and can either be 3D printed or purchased in parts then assembled...

## Former residents of NH youth center demand federal probe of abuse claims

Frustrated former residents of New Hampshire’s only youth detention center are pushing for a federal investigation into allegations of decades of abuse.

The Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester, previously called the Youth Development Center, has been under criminal investigation by the state since 2019. Ten former workers and an 11th who worked at a pretrial facility in Concord were arrested in 2021.

Close to 1,000 men and woman have sued the state alleging physical, sexual or emotional abuse. But the slow pace of the criminal and civil proceedings has some calling for the federal Department of Justice to step in.

“Get the state out of it, because they’re not looking to give us real justice,” said Charles Glenn, who spent several years at the facility in the mid-1990s. “They’re complicit to sexual physical violence in this institution for over 40 years because for over 40 years, they’ve done nothing.”

Glenn, 42, helped organize a rally planned for Friday afternoon in Concord where half a dozen former residents are scheduled to speak. He won’t be there because he is serving a 40-year-to-life sentence for second-degree murder, but his wife will speak on his behalf.

In his lawsuit, Glenn alleges he was raped by three workers at the youth center and beaten by a dozen more, suffering multiple broken bones.

Glenn said in a phone interview that the abuse started within a week of his arrival, when he came out of his room one night after having a nightmare and was dragged back in, put in restraints and beaten.

“I kept screaming and crying, and I was scared to be in there, and they wrapped a towel around my face to muffle the screams,” he said.

The abuse escalated when he was moved to another housing unit, Glenn said.

“We were combative verbally, and they wanted to demasculate us and humiliate us and do something that would break us," he said.

## Sky Chef catering workers rally for pay raise at Miami airport – The Militant

MIAMI — Nearly 200 members of UNITE HERE Local 355 marched in the rain and rallied outside the LSG Sky Chef catering facility near Miami International Airport to back workers’ demand for an immediate raise to $20 an hour. Union members came from work sites throughout the area.

Union members spoke in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole about fights they’ve waged over the past year that won higher wages.

Airline catering workers here prepare, pack and deliver food and beverages served aboard flights for American Airlines and other major U.S. airlines. Two-thirds of the food and drink on board flights departing from Miami International are prepared by workers at Sky Chef. They are fighting for an immediate raise from $16 an hour.

UNITE HERE Local 355 says the fight they are waging is part of the series of strikes taking place across the country today, from the UAW strike against the Big Three to the battle at International Flavors and Fragrances in Tennessee.

Sky Chef workers voted by 99% to authorize a strike at any time over their demand.

“It’s disgusting that the hospitality industry makes the profits it does and doesn’t pay its workers enough to live on,” Nick Lenzi, a maintenance worker and union shop steward at the St. Regis Hotel, told Rachele Fruit, a member of Local 355 and Socialist Workers Party candidate for U.S. Senate from Florida. “We’re not the only low-wage industry,” he said, “but we’re in the spotlight because we’re union. The unions are under attack here in the state of Florida and we have to grow our rights and our wages.”...

## Solidarity rally held for Nashville Jewish community amid Israeli War

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Nearly 700 people attended the Jewish Federation of Greater Nashville’s solidarity community-wide rally Monday evening at the Gordon Jewish Community Center.

Several gathered with heavy hearts, emotion, and concern still coming to grips with the tragedy in Israel after the Hamas terrorists group attacked their homeland Saturday.

During the rally, members of the Jewish community sung songs, prayed, and learned of the latest updates of what’s occurring in their homeland.

“My husband and daughter were both drafted to serve in different areas of our country. As our loved ones stand on the front lines, our hearts are heavy,” shared an Israeli woman through a video message.

The Jewish Federation of Greater Nashville condemns the attacks and mourns the mounting loss of lives. The organization describes the scenes as indiscriminate attacks that are heartbreaking and reprehensible.

Barbara Dab, the communication director for the Jewish Federation of Greater Nashville, explained the impact the war has on Jewish people in the United States and in Nashville.

“This is a big generalization, but I think that if you talk to almost any Jewish person in the United States there’s a connection. We’ve visited there, we have family there, friends there, colleagues there. A lot of us have relatives now who are on the ground now serving in the IDF and trying very hard to put an end to this horrible war,” said Dab.

Dab also shared how there are people in the Midstate have been directly impacted by the war.

“We have friends and relatives that are being called back to the frontlines. It’s everything, people are running for shelter when they hear the sirens they have 30 seconds to get to safety, and that’s part of their daily lives now,” said Dab.

Governor Bill Lee addressed the crowd with a message of hope, reinforcing that the country and the state of Tennessee stands with Israeli people.

“We believe and have faith. There is hope and we have great hope jus...

## Police provocatively break up peaceful protest against Gaza genocide in Royal Oak, Michigan

Police in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak provocatively and violently broke up a peaceful march against the escalating Israeli genocide in Palestine on Saturday called by Jewish Voices for Peace, where over 200 youth and workers, including several families with children, demonstrated.

The chants, speeches and comments by participants who spoke to the World Socialist Web Site directed their anger at the complicity of the Democratic Party leadership in the Biden administration and state, including the now ubiquitous chant “charging” Biden, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, and US Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow for the genocide.

After rain had thinned the protest, a major contingent of city police vehicles, some unmarked, blocked an entire street and intersection to stop the march. Police then violently pushed themselves into the crowd and arrested two protesters.

A section of the demonstrators then picketed outside the Royal Oak Police Department to demand the release of those detained. A participant at the rally told the WSWS that the police targeted the woman leading the protest after a portion of the crowd had already left and that one person was released and the other would likely be held until Monday on charges of assaulting a police officer.

Another participant told the WSWS afterward that she had gone to the police station to protest.

“The charges were bogus; they said they assaulted a police officer. There were videos showing that they didn’t.

“They had police cars all over the place. They wouldn’t tell us anything. They were shoving people. They wouldn’t give any explanations of what is going on. They would just smile with a smirk.

“The videos show the whole arrests. They said he was resisting, but he was not. I saw with my own eyes that they handcuffed Joe. He wasn’t resisting. He wasn’t doing anything. Alexis, the one leading the chants, came over to see what was wrong and they pus...

## Local group holds peace march and vigil for Gaza in Carbondale

Over 40 people walk down Colorado Highway 133 in Carbondale on Sunday as part of Ceasefire Now Roaring Fork Valley's peace march, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

Jonson Kuhn/The Aspen Times

While organizers of a new local group, Ceasefire Now Roaring Fork Valley, choose to not share last names with press for concern of potential backlash, they’re more than happy to share their message of peace by calling for an immediate ceasefire within Israel’s Gaza strip.

Over 40 people gathered outside of the Cowen Center in Carbondale on Sunday for a silent peace march/vigil for Gaza. Prayers and speeches were made before people marched down Colorado Highway 133 with handmade signs and drums.

“We stand for all life, you can hold two truths at the same time,” said Nuni, one of the event organizers. “I can be in support of a ceasefire and not in support of Hamas. Those two can exist and do exist within me.”

Nuni said she had only just recently joined the group last week and was surprised to find as many like-minded people throughout the valley who, like her, were struggling with the amount of grief revolving around the Israel and Hamas conflict. She said as soon as she joined, members immediately began organizing Sunday’s March and trying to find ways of spreading awareness in a way that wouldn’t “create more division.”

“I think it was received pretty well, there were a lot of people that seemed to be in support of us today,” she said. “There were a couple of naysayers but that’s to be expected, especially with something that’s so polarized. If any of these people were to stop and talk to us, we would hope that we could help them have a different perspective on ...

## Tidewater Ukrainian community comes together two years after Russian invasion

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) – Saturday, February 24 marks two years since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Anna Makhorkina, Ph.D. spoke to Digital Host Sarah Goode in a Digital Desk livestream about the impact on the local Ukrainian-American community and upcoming events. Watch the conversation in the video player on this page.

Makhorkina’s parents live in Ukraine. She remembers the moment two years ago trying to reach them on the phone.

AdChoices ADVERTISING

“I remember I first started calling them around 11 p.m. February 23 here and February 24 there,” Makhorkina said. “I couldn’t reach them for many, many hours. That was terrifying”.

Days before the Russian invasion, the Tidewater Ukrainian Cultural Association was in the midst of planning a rally for Ukraine.

“Leading up to the full-scale invasion on February 24, our Ukrainian-American community here in Hampton Roads has already started to plan events, awareness and educational events to bring attention to what was happening on the Russia-Ukraine border,” Makhorkina said.

Days later, the rally took place in Norfolk. Makhorkina felt the community support.

“That rally, we had so many people showing up on Friday,” Makhorkina said.

Where Makhorkina’s parents live in western Ukraine, she once felt was safe during the conflict, but that has changed.

“And, of course, overtime, over the two years, nowhere is safe,” Makhorkina said.

Locally, Makhorkina says the Ukrainian community support never goes away.

“The support in the American-Ukrainian community is non-waning because we literally wake up with news from Ukraine and go to bed with news from Ukraine,” Makhorkina said.

She says that support continues from friends, neighbors and community members.

Jewish community comes together to show solidarity for those impacted by the war on Israel

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Numerous people gathered at the University of North Florida Monday night to pray and stand in solidarity with Israel after a surprise attack from Hamas caused carnage in the Middle East.

More than 900 Israelis have lost their lives in the attack that Rabbi Shmuli Novack said happened on what was supposed to be a joyous Jewish holiday.

“We started getting folks coming in and sharing very very sad details. In the beginning, It’s like okay, maybe he’s a little bit exaggerating. And this trickle becomes a torrent of devastating, terrible news,” Novack said.

Avi Zaguri told News4JAX his brother’s home is near the battlegrounds.

“The Palestinians bomb his house and thank God he was safe because he was in a shelter. And thank God he got all his kids, his family and his wife. My family is also safe but you know, everybody’s concerned and very scared from the situation,” Zaguri said.

The house was not destroyed, according to Zaguri, but the home received a considerable amount of damage from the impact.

## Anti-abortion activists rally at State House

Energized by the fall of Roe v. Wade, Maine anti-abortion activists flooded the Capitol on Tuesday in hopes of blocking the expansion of abortion access in this decidedly blue state.

“It’s exciting, I never thought I would live to see a post-Roe era,” said Barbara Ford, who runs the Shepherd’s Godparent Home in Bangor, a pregnancy crisis center. “But now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe, we have much to do here in Maine.”

Ford told the crowd of more than 250 people gathered in the Hall of Flags that Gov. Janet Mills is mounting an aggressive pro-abortion campaign from the Blaine House. She urged those in attendance to speak out against legislation proposed by Mills that would legalize abortion after viability with a doctor’s approval, as well as five others that would expand abortion access in Maine. One of those bills targets pregnancy crisis centers like Shepherd’s Godparent.

Advocates of expanded abortion access stayed away from Tuesday’s event, letting anti-abortion activists have their day and saying that they plan to show up in force when bills are heard by committees. Republican lawmakers mingled among the crowd, but Democratic lawmakers steered clear. They remain confident that last fall’s election – which saw Mills handily beat Republican Paul LePage, who is personally opposed to abortion – is a sign that voters have spoken.

“Abortion care is medical care, yet across the country fundamental rights and freedoms are being taken away or restricted at an alarming rate,” said House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, D-Portland. “But the opposite is happening here in Maine. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure that reproductive health care and family planning is affordable and accessible in every part of the state.”

State lawmakers will be considering a dozen abortion bills this legislative session: six would expand access and six would restrict it.

## Supporters of abortion, reproductive rights amendment rally in cities throughout Ohio

Supporters of an amendment on the Nov. 7 ballot that could enshrine abortion and reproductive rights into the Ohio Constitution held rallies throughout the state days before the deadline to register to vote and the start of early voting.

In Columbus, backers of Issue 1 gathered on the west lawn of the Statehouse holding signs and cheering. Lauren Blauvelt with Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights was at the Columbus rally.

“We are excited to be in six cities talking about voting ‘yes’ on Issue 1,” Blauvelt said.

Blauvelt told the crowd passage of Issue 1 on Nov. 7 would not only protect abortion rights but also put people, not politicians, in charge of decisions about other reproductive rights like IVF and birth control.

Speakers urged those gathered to keep registering voters until the deadline Tuesday. And the leaders of the rally said it was important to make sure Ohioans get out to vote for the measure. Supporters of the amendment say it would put Ohioans, not politicians, in charge of their own reproductive health care decisions.

The rally at the Statehouse was just one of six events held statewide. Similar rallies were held in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton and Columbus.

On Friday, opponents of Issue 1 rallied at the Statehouse as part of their annual March for Life 2023. The Ohio Republican Party held a “get out the vote” event Saturday morning, featuring a small group of activists who gathered to hear from Gov. Mike DeWine, Attorney General Dave Yost, Sen. Matt Dolan (R-Chagrin Falls) and Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Dolan and LaRose are both running for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate next year.

Tuesday marks the voter registration deadline for the November election. Early voting begins Wednesday....

## UC Berkeley students hold demonstration to support people of Gaza

Thousands of students across the Bay Area walked out of classes Wednesday as part of a planned demonstration to show support for the people of Gaza during the ongoing conflict.

One of the largest demonstrations was at UC Berkeley where more than a thousand people gathered in Sproul Plaza.

"What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!" chanted dozens of protestors as they walked toward the rally at the plaza.

Many of the people holding signs and flats at the demonstration were wearing some type of mask.

"Out of concern for my future and a concern for my family's wellbeing, I don't want to be identified," one protestor said.

The Berkeley student did not want to give KPIX 5 his name, saying he fears the repercussions of attending the rally.

"There's a lot of backlash coming at people who are in support of this and mischaracterizations of their opinions. And that mischaracterization leads to people losing jobs, getting kicked out and expelled from school, having future job offers completely wiped off the board," said the unnamed student.

He points out the irony of the current situation given that the Free Speech Movement started at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, yet many of the students who attended Wednesday's rally say they are afraid of publicly supporting Palestine.

They pointed to numerous examples of backlash they say they could face, including on the UC Berkeley campus where corporate law professor Steven Solomon recently wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled "Don't Hire My Anti-Semetic Law Students".

On the East Coast, students at Harvard and NYU have had job offers revoked or been blacklisted by employers after signing letters expressing support for the people of Palestine.

"For a lot of these people who don't have a covering on, I mean, I admire their bravery, right? But for me it's just that I have a certain fear as an Arab and as a Muslim that I might be identified, I might be watched, I might be like monitored," said the unidentified s...

## Vigil marks 25 years since police officers shot and killed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx

Vigil honors Amadou Diallo 25 years after he was killed by NYPD officers

NEW YORK -- Sunday marks 25 years since Amadou Diallo was shot and killed by a hail of police bullets in the Bronx.

A vigil and celebration of life was held Saturday in his honor on the same street the tragedy unfolded.

Kadiatou Diallo locked arms with other grieving mothers, walking down Wheeler Avenue, also known as Amadou Diallo place.

"It's a quarter of a century, so I had to return here without crying," Diallo said.

On Feb. 4, 1999, her son, Amadou Diallo, was killed by a hail of NYPD bullets outside of his Bronx apartment. Officials say 41 shots were fired at him by plain clothes officers, part of the NYPD's street crimes unit, who mistook him for an armed rape suspect. Officers said they thought Diallo was reaching for a gun, but he was reaching for his wallet.

"My son was educated. He was a hard-working young man. He was my first born," Kadiatou Diallo said. "I want to pick up Amadou, dust him off and give him back his story."

It was one of the first police-involved shootings in New York City that sparked national outrage and conversations about race and police relations.

The officers involved were charged with second-degree murder, but were acquitted at trial.

"My family and I are standing today with gratitude to New Yorkers because you guys helped us, prayed with us, comforted us when we were in need of that. We prayed together. We marched together. We protested together. We demanded changes together. And the journey continues," said Diallo's mother.

Saturday night at a vigil and celebration of life for Diallo, elected officials, advocates and the mothers of Sean Bell and Eric Garner, who also lost their sons at the hands of police, spoke.

"This great woman has been on the battlefield for 25 years," said Gwen Carr, mother of Eri...

## Three protesters interrupt DeSantis rally in Ames; one tackled on stage

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had his rally at the Ames Jethro’s interrupted three times by protesters, including one who briefly stood on stage next to the governor with a banner that read “DeSantis: climate criminal” before being tackled onto the ground by security.

“This is [what is] wrong with the college system, right there,” DeSantis said while pointing at the protester. “That’s exhibit A.”

Those events occurred just minutes after Family Leader CEO Bob Vander Plaats introduced DeSantis and cited his track record of endorsing three straight winners of competitive Iowa Republican Caucuses, though none of those winners went on to be the Republican nominee.

“Ted Cruz was supposed to get beat in 2016. He comes in, shocks the media, shocks the nation, shocks the world [and] wins the Iowa Caucuses,” Vander Plaats said. “I believe on Monday night, this guy Ron DeSantis will shock the media, shock the nation, shock the world [and will] win the Iowa Caucuses with your help.”

Vander Plaats also referenced Gov. Kim Reynolds’ endorsement of DeSantis and said he believes Washington, D.C. “could use a bit more” of Iowa and Florida.

“I look at the peers of Gov. DeSantis – Kim Reynolds being one of them – and the reason I like him so much is he resembles a lot of what Gov. Reynolds has done here,” Vander Plaats said.

DeSantis’ campaign appeared cognizant of the rally’s proximity to Iowa State University as they passed out “Cyclones for DeSantis” stickers and during his speech, DeSantis explained how his five-year-old son has become a Cyclone fan after buying a Cyclone football themed checkers board at Machine Shed in Des Moines, Iowa.

However, that did not prevent DeSantis from criticizing higher education and students who he said earn “relatively worthless” degrees in things like “zombie studies.” He also said Floridians should not “be funding indoctrination camps” in reference to colleges and universities.

“Every five years [tenured professors] can be terminated for poor...

## Vt. students to rally against youth smoking, vaping

MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont high school students are marching in Montpelier Thursday in opposition to youth vaping and smoking.

Students from 11 schools across the state will represent Our Voices Xposed, a movement dedicated to speaking out against the dangers of youth vaping and tobacco use, and against the products designed to get them hooked.

Vermont health leaders say youth vaping remains a top concern. School leaders say students continue to sneak off to the bathroom to vape while at school.

The Vermont Senate last week approved a bill that would ban the retail sale of flavored cigarettes, e-cigarettes and e-liquids. It would also get the Attorney General’s Office to report on the extent to which Vermont may legally restrict advertising and regulate labels for the products.

Thursday’s march will go from Montpelier City Hall to the Statehouse. The youths will then meet with the governor and lawmakers.

## Out MOV holds Pride celebration at City Park

PARKERSBURG — Out MOV held its third in-person Pride celebration Saturday afternoon at Parkersburg City Park.

“We have around 50 vendors this year,” said Out MOV Board President Liz Hamperian. “That ranges from businesses, crafters, community members and food trucks.”

In addition to the many vendors, Out MOV also hosted five performing artists as well as a drag performance.

There was plenty of entertainment and ways to celebrate Pride Month, including a photo wall, in which attendees could take a picture with their friends or with a friendly chihuahua named Betty.

Betty was always sporting rainbow sunglasses and had multiple outfit changes, all featuring a rainbow color scheme.

There were vendors that had crafts for the children that came to celebrate. Many vendors had free items for participants to enjoy, from fidget toys to bracelets to mini flags. Large flags were also available for sale at multiple vendors.

A number of dogs were part of the festivities, including those brought by the Humane Society of Parkersburg, hoping to drum up interest in adopting the canines.

There was a crowd of protesters at Saturday’s celebration. They were set up around 200 feet from the celebration and were especially loud during the start of the event.

The celebration on Saturday is the first of many this month for the community. Parkersburg Pride will host another event at City Park from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday, June 10. The celebration will go from noon to 4:00 p.m. MOV Independent’s Pride Party is slated for 3-6 p.m. Saturday, June 17, on the lawn of the Armory in Marietta....

## More than 200 gather to protest Taiwan official's 'transit' in San Francisco

More than 200 overseas Chinese who support peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait gathered in San Francisco on Thursday to protest against Taiwan's deputy head Lai Ching-te's "transit" in the United States.

The crowd gathered around the hotel where Lai stayed, shouting "One China" while waving Chinese flags and holding up signs such as "Taiwan independence is a dead end".

Zou Zhiqiang, deputy secretary-general of the Alliance for China's Peaceful Reunification in the U.S., said that Lai's remarks about "peace" during his "transit" in New York was meant to deceive the people of Taiwan and dispel U.S.' suspicions about his radical pro-independence ideology.

"However, in the past seven years under the Democratic Progressive Party's rule in Taiwan, cross-Strait relations have been made dangerous and have posed a threat to peace. The whole world believes that Taiwan is the most dangerous place," said Zou, a Taiwan native who participated in the protest.

The best way to avoid war between the two sides of the Strait is to abandon the stance of "Taiwan independence", adhere to the one-China principle and pursue a path of peaceful development, he added....

## Metro Justice will hold rally in support of making RG&E publicly owned

[anvplayer video=”5178178″ station=”998131″]

ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Metro Justice will hold a rally on Tuesday night to demand that city officials support the study needed to consider replacing RG&E with a public utility.

The group says a publicly-owned utility would lower utility rates, create union jobs, and help to transition to clean energy. A legal analysis from the Environmental Advocacy Clinic at the University at Buffalo School of Law will be at the rally.

The rally at Rochester City Hall starts at 5:30 p.m.

## LGBTQ+ rolling through central Kentucky to rally against SB 150

This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (FOX 56) — LGBTIQ+ plus activists rolled through central Kentucky Friday to fight against Senate Bill 150.

“All of us are here today because we know trans kids. We love trans kids. We support trans kids. And that’s not ever going to change,” said activist Mason Chernosky.

Progress Kentucky said it is on a mission to go around central Kentucky where there is a large LGBTIQQ community to show support for one another.

“We are trying to get the message to legislators that majority, Kentuckians support the veto,” said Chernosky.

Now that Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a controversial health care bill dealing with transgender children. Progress Kentucky is hitting the road hoping to change the minds of those who support the legislation.

“It is something that I believe will be challenged in court and no matter what, no matter what happens in the courts or in the legislature or anywhere else in Kentucky, we are going to continue to be here for trans people,” said Chernosky.

The republican-dominated legislature will return on Wednesday and is likely to override this veto — which passed with near-unanimous GOP support. Josh Buckman a medical social worker said many of his patients have contemplated suicide.

“And that was probably what has done more to bring me out here today,” Buckman said.

Progress Kentucky members said they’re fearful of what could happen next.

“There is a possibility that if this law goes into effect, there will be trans children who will commit suicide. And those suicides will be on the Republican-controlled legislature,” Doug Price said.

The caravan made its way through Lexington and Berea through a multi-care procession.

## St. Sabina Church hosts ‘Summer of Peace’ rally & march to highlight gun violence

This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

CHICAGO — A large crowd of people from neighborhoods across the city joined together outside of St. Sabina Church for a rally and march Friday to uplift the community and encourage those committing gun crimes to stop ending lives too soon.

Members of St. Sabina Church and Chicago residents united Friday evening hoping their presence will encourage people to value life and help stop the gun violence.

The “Summer of Peace Kick off Rally and March, a proactive effort to ignite unity and peace across the city, as hundreds of the people crowded outside of St. Sabina Church on Chicago’s South Side Friday evening with attendees pleading for the community to put the guns down.

The crowd filled with attendees of all ages and backgrounds desperate for peace with many knowing the heartache of losing a loved one to senseless violence.

After encouraging words from rapper G Herbo and spoken word artist J Ivy, the crowd took to the streets and made their way down 79th Street to Ashland Avenue where an innocent 69-year-old mother was recently killed.

Every Friday through September, Father Pfleger and community members will march through neighborhoods impacted by violence. He said the Friday marches through neighborhoods give residents hope for a more peaceful city....

## San Jose homeless hotel tenants protest deplorable conditions

Christina Correa was homeless for 11 years before finding temporary housing. She moved into SureStay Hotel in North San Jose one year ago, an environment she said is cockroach infested, peppered with mold and has faucets that spew dirty tap water. She never imagined getting off the streets would put her health at risk.

The hotel was one of the first to be repurposed by San Jose for interim housing under Project HomeKey, a program designed to get homeless people off the streets during the COVID-19 pandemic. From the start, the project has been on shaky ground. With years of unsafe housing problems and city mismanagement, residents are fed up and frustrations have hit a boiling point.

Correa and about 10 other SureStay residents, along with housing advocates, protested outside the hotel yesterday, holding neon signs and calling for better living conditions after years of neglect.

“Even on the street when I was homeless, I didn’t have to deal with cockroaches like this,” she told San José Spotlight. “This is bad.”

Residents of the 76-room hotel are calling for operators to clean up the cockroaches and mold and provide a permanent path to housing. They also want to be treated with dignity and respect, as they’re housed under strict conditions where they say management uses the siren on a bullhorn to notify them when meals are ready.

Tenants told San José Spotlight meals, which are provided three times a day, are only available for 10 to 15 minutes. They are not allowed to bring food to their neighbors with mobility issues from the parking lot where it is served.

Correa requested a move from the second floor to the first in anticipation of a surgery around September, which would make it easier for her to access services provided at the hotel. Due to her health, she can’t move her items on her own and her caretaker is currently unavailable. Management offered no additional assistance and refused to change her move-out date from July 30, she said.

“Every day is a ri...

## Effort to lower BOE voting age from 18 to 16 kicks off with rally at Jersey City City Hall

An effort to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 in board of education races kicked off with a rally with dozens in attendance at Jersey City City Hall last night.



By John Heinis and Daniel Ulloa/Hudson County View

The rally began with chants of “Lower the age! Ignite the change!,” “Tomorrow’s leaders are voting today!,” and “Teens unite! Let’s get this right!”

“When I get asked the question why should the voting age be lowered from 18 to 16 in school board elections, I think back to a time where the school board threatened to cancel sports in the Jersey City Public Schools,” began Vote @16 Co-Chair Zachary Zabut.

“And at times like these students are enraged, they call for action from a school board where they don’t even have a say in electing. So it’s time, it’s time to give teenagers a voice in electing the people that make the decisions that affect their education and it’s time that teens unite because we have the most informed opinions on what the schools actually need.”

Vote @16 Co-Chair Azra Bano explained why she believes voting rights should be extended to 16 year olds in BOE races.

“Voting is a fundamental right … We have unique insights into the daily values of our educational experience, allowing us to provide a valuable perspective on issues that matter. to us most,” she stated.

“For example, Fordham just recently banned AP Psychology, AP History, and gender sexuality. This truly was unacceptable: we need to be able to choose what we learn and no one is allowed to restrict our knowledge and education.”

Zack Barkouch, a 16-year-old student at McNair Academic High School said that he has experienced two floods at the facility each year thus far, which negatively impacts students ability to learn.

“Even alumni know that these problems have been plaguing our schools for a very long time and a change needs to happen and us having a voice, us finally being heard, and myself being 16 years old, I can finally elect those who will get things done.”

## Dozens rally at the state capitol urging lawmakers to pass stricter gun safety laws

ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Dozens of Minnesotans took to the state capitol on Thursday demanding lawmakers pass tougher gun laws to make their communities safer, as the legislature considers measures that would expand background checks and raise the age limit to buy military-style weapons.

Moms Demand Action in Minnesota held its annual day of action in St. Paul, sharing stories of how lives have been profoundly impacted by gun violence. It comes just days after yet another mass shooting, this time at Michigan State University where three are dead and five others are critically wounded.

Gun safety advocates are pushing for criminal background checks for all gun sales and transfers; safe storage laws; and a so-called "red flag" law, which are extreme risk protection orders that would allow a family member or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily ban a person from having a gun if deemed a risk to themselves or others.

These three measures advanced out of a House committee earlier this month and they are law in other states. Another proposal that was approved by the same panel would require gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm within two days.

"That will save lives in Minnesota because that is what we're here for," said Molly Leutz, chapter president of Moms Demand Action in Minnesota. "We have for years absorbed bad faith arguments of a slippery slope. People telling us criminals won't obey laws anyway—literally an argument against laws at all. And we have heard that it just doesn't matter. But that's not the side I'm on and it's not the side any of you are on it does matter. And it matters to the majority of Minnesotans."

Supporters of tougher gun laws have been pushing for these laws for years. They say it's past time that state leaders act as gun deaths plague communities in Minnesota and across the country.

A MinnPost poll after the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last Spring year found 64% of Minnesotans were in favor of implement...

## Issue 1 rally held at Statehouse as registration deadline approaches

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Ohio is 30 days away from the Nov. 7 general election, and possibly the biggest measure on the ballot is Issue 1, which would enshrine reproductive rights into the state constitution.

Issue 1 supporters gathered in front of the Ohio Statehouse Sunday to rally, support, and encourage Ohioans to register to vote. The rally was one of six held across Ohio.

“Today’s our bands-off day of action,” Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights Co-chairperson Lauren Blauvelt said. “We’re in six cities across Ohio to talk about voting yes on Issue 1. We’re here with our super supporters who are here. They’re going to knock on doors, they’re calling voters, we’re talking to voters.”

On Friday, those opposing Issue 1 also took to the Statehouse with the same message: get out and vote.

The “vote no” side said the proposed amendment is too broad and is not where Ohioans stand on the issue of abortion.

“There will be a day to debate what the policy should be in Ohio, but right now, the issue is whether this is the right policy and I think that most people think this is the wrong policy,” Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said.

Tuesday is the last day to register to vote for November’s election. For more information on how to do so, click here.

Early voting begins Wednesday....

## Growing Armenian community mourns Nagorno-Karabakh exodus in campus vigil

Those who gathered for the vigil left roses and candles on the University chapel's steps. Elisabeth Stewart / The Daily Princetonian

As night fell over the University chapel last Thursday, about 50 students, faculty, and community members gathered to commemorate the lives lost during the mass exodus of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians from the breakaway state of Nagorno-Karabakh following Azerbaijan’s recent invasion. Until this month, upwards of 120,000 Armenians lived in the contested region and their departure in the face of fears of ethnic cleansing has been referred to as a cultural genocide.

On Sept. 19, Azerbaijan launched a military attack into Nagorno-Karabakh, known by ethnic Armenians as Artsakh, and took control of the region, following three decades of territorial conflict and a months long Azerbaijani blockade. As of late September, over 80 percent of the region's inhabitants had fled their homes, and the government of Nagorno-Karabakh announced that it would dissolve itself by January 2024. While Azerbaijani officials have denied reprisal against Armenians, Armenians have fled in the face of longtime violent anti-Armenian rhetoric and policy from the Azerbaijani government.

ADVERTISEMENT

The vigil was organized by the Princeton Armenian Society (PAS) “in remembrance of those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and self-determination of the land’s Armenian population,” according to the flyer for the event. It marked an important moment in the relatively new society's efforts to serve Armenian interests on Princeton's campus.

At the event, PAS Co-President Hayk Yengibaryan ’26, spoke about the cultural importance of Artsakh. Yengibaryan shared that Artsakh was an Armenian cultural and religious hotbed, the site of the first Armenian school in the early 400s, and the birthplace of the Armenian alphabet.

“This vigil was to come and commemorate not only the rich history of this region, but also all the fallen soldiers, the innocent civilians, the...

## Op-Ed: Tucson’s Multifaith Coalition Shows Up for Pride

What comes to mind when you think of a parade? Music, dancing, fanciful clothing, even a float or two? A Pride parade is all that and more: it marks an exuberant and enthusiastic celebration for and by the LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual) community. (The additional “+” stands for all of the other identities not encompassed in the short acronym.)

But Pride is more than just a party; Pride is also protest. Both the month (celebrated June in more temperate climates around the world) and the movement arose out of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in Manhattan, when gay and trans folks stood up to police violence and forever changed the struggle for LGBTQIA+ rights in the United States.

The struggle is real. There are, to date, more than 500 pieces of anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation that have been introduced in statehouses across our country this year. Almost 300 of those are anti-trans, and many of them target trans youth.

Even though research strongly shows that affirming and inclusive environments, such as households and educational settings, actively reduce the rate of suicide among this population, the Arizona State Legislature introduced thirty anti-LGBTQIA+ bills this past session.

Among the proposals was legislation that would have made it illegal for teachers and other school personnel to respect the pronouns of a trans or non-binary student without written parental permission (AZ SB 1001); a bill that would have put schools at risk of litigation for providing supportive and affirming spaces for LGBTQIA+ students (AZ SB 1005); and a bill which would have banned trans students and school personnel from using school restrooms that match their gender identity (AZ SB 1040).

Few of the Arizona bills passed, and none was signed into law by Gov. Katie Hobbs. But merely introducing anti-transgender bills and peddling anti-transgender rhetoric has a damaging impact on youth in Arizona. A Trevor Project survey shows that a startling 85...

## National Justice Party protests Montgomery County school board over ‘gender identity policy’

Powered by odysee embed generator

Rockville, Maryland – On Saturday, Supporters of the White civil rights organization, the National Justice Party (NJP), protested outside the Montgomery County Board of Education (MCBOE) in opposition to what they call “depraved” gender identity policies in the classroom.

The protest was launched in the wake of a federal appeals court ruling that forbids parents from challenging the policy or those like it, which some believe may have led to allegations of rape and sex trafficking of a young girl. According to sources on the ground, approximately 20 NJP activists braved the rain and gathered on the corner of Mannakee Street and Hungerford Drive, where they delivered chants and speeches in opposition to the school district’s policies.

“The NJP came out and exposed their agenda to the public,” said NJP activist Lars Rainhart in a request for comment. “There was a solar eclipse behind the cloud cover during the demonstration, so the guys were out there under a black sun and the major storm that was forecast split around the area of the action at the last minute. It seemed like the forces of good were behind us.”

Approximately 20 NJP Supporters and volunteer activists marched on Saturday in opposition to the MCBOE’s gender identity policy for students. The policy can not be challenged via the courts, thanks to the ruling of a Trump-appointed judge. Photo: Justice Report.

“For the past few years, the Montgomery County Board of Education has been pursuing a policy of secrecy regarding the ‘gender transitioning’ of its students,” said activist Christopher Woolery in a speech. “…Staff, and by extension the children they prey upon, are encouraged to keep this as discreet as possible.

According to the MCBOE Student Gender Identity policy guide, students who disclose their ‘transition status’ to teachers or other students are entitled to keep that information a secret. Other rules outlined in the dubious policy include ways teachers can ...

## Seattle-area residents worry, rally as fighting escalates in Israel, Gaza

A world away, Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel has reverberated in the Seattle area, as many local Jewish and political leaders denounced Hamas militants, hundreds gathered in demonstrations and people with ties to Israel and the Palestinian territories anxiously waited for updates from the region.

The escalating fighting, which has killed at least 900 Israelis and 700 Palestinians, lays bare the complexity and horrific violent history of this divisive conflict, as videos of Hamas militants kidnapping and killing civilians depicted the deadliest single day in Israel’s 75-year history and its retaliation caused death and destruction in Gaza.

On Monday evening, hundreds gathered in downtown Bellevue: People with the American Jewish Committee passed out signs saying “Seattle Stands With Israel” and cars rolling through the intersection honked their horns in support.

It was the second day of demonstrations in the area; hundreds had gathered Sunday evening in downtown Kirkland, forcing police to separate opposing demonstrators toward different sides of the road....

## Angela Alsobrooks makes it official, kicks off Senate campaign with rally

Four Democratic candidates are now vying to succeed Sen. Ben Cardin who retires in 2024

MARYLAND (DC News Now) — Angela Alsobrooks held a rally Wednesday to officially launch her 2024 run for Maryland’s U.S. Senate seat. She’s one candidate in a Democratic primary campaign that is becoming increasingly crowded.

Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, seeks to become the first African American — and the second woman — in history to win a Senate seat in Maryland history. The seat will be open in 2024 because longtime incumbent Ben Cardin has decided not to seek re-election.

“All of the issues we discuss in this campaign around public safety, around education, around health care, issues that they can feel confident that I have understood as a public official,” said Alsobrooks, who also served as an elected state’s attorney in the county.

“You deserve a senator that not only fights for you but who thinks like you,” she said. “A senator who looks and who lives like the people they’re supposed to represent.”

Alsobrooks has joined a crowded field that includes business titan and U.S. Rep. David Trone who plans on spending his own fortune to win office. Trone dropped the first paid ad of the campaign Tuesday with a seven-figure, statewide buy, the same day Alsobrooks released a video confirming her as a candidate.

Others include Montgomery County Councilman Will Jawando, who like Trone announced they were running last week, and activist Jerome Segal.

Alsobrooks said she believes her campaign will raise the needed cash to compete with Trone but that it’s the connection with the public that will win the day.

“I know we will have the funding to run this race but we will keep it focused as well on people,” she said.

Larry Sabato, the founder and director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said that money will be a big factor in this primary — and that spending would help sell a candidate to the public.

“You don’t have to outspend your oppon...

## New College of Florida 'alternative' ceremony serves as part celebration, part protest

SARASOTA COUNTY, Fla. — Gathering outside on a warm but pleasant evening near downtown Sarasota, dozens of New College of Florida graduates not only celebrated their academic achievements, but also protested what they view as a “hostile” takeover by Gov. Ron DeSantis and his acolytes of the college they love.

K.C. Casey and Madison Markham organized the gathering, dubbed a “Commencement: On Our Terms,” and according to Markham, 90 of the school's 118 graduates attended.

Recent Stories from fox4now.com

“I think an event like this shows the state, shows New College, that students are willing to fight for what we believe in,” Casey said.

The graduation ceremony hosted Thursday night was not the college’s official commencement. Instead, it served as an “alternative” for students who feel their liberal arts college in Sarasota is no longer the school they first enrolled in years ago.

New College has been the site of a conservative takeover championed by Governor Ron DeSantis.

Earlier this year, DeSantis replaced six members of the college's board of trustees with conservative allies. That board fired the school’s president and scrapped its diversity office.

Just this week, the governor and the school’s new leaders celebrated the college’s future, which they believe will set more students up for successful careers.

“I would love for this to be, and I think it will be, the top classical liberal arts college in America,” the governor said during a bill signing ceremony at New College.

“We are on the verge of having the largest incoming class ever in the history of New College in just 90 days,” added Richard Cororan, the school’s interim president.

Friday, the college will host its graduation ceremony. Scott Atlas, an advisor to President Donald Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic, will give the commencement address.

"Tomorrow we’re being recognized for our degree, but today we’re being celebrated for our achievements and who we are,” Markham, the organizer of the ...

## Prayers for Israel, rally for Palestine: Lehigh Valley residents gather on both sides of clash

In Allentown this week, as bloodshed begat more bloodshed in Israel and Gaza, prayers and a call to action in support of Israel were offered, contrasting with a vocal rally in support of Palestine.

The rally Friday afternoon organized by the Muslim Association of Lehigh Valley drew an estimated 150 people to Allentown’s Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Seventh and Hamilton streets, followed by a march to the Edward N. Cahn U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building where the Lehigh Valley’s congresswoman has an office.

Three days earlier, members of the Jewish faith gathered Tuesday evening at the Jewish Community Center to mourn those killed in last weekend’s deadly terror attacks on Israel and to back the brutal response.

The backdrop, in the Middle East, saw Palestinians begin a mass exodus Friday from northern Gaza after Israel’s military told some 1 million people to evacuate toward the southern part of the besieged territory, an unprecedented order ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group. Israel has bombarded Gaza round-the-clock since Hamas’ attack last Saturday, Oct. 6, in which its fighters massacred hundreds in southern Israel and snatched some 150 people to Gaza as hostages.

In a deepening humanitarian crisis, Israel has stopped the water flow from its national water company into Gaza, additionally blocking electricity, food and fuel from entering the coastal enclave. Israel said Thursday it would allow no supplies into Gaza until Hamas frees the hostages.

The week-old war has sent tensions soaring across the region. Israel has traded fire in recent days with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, sparking fears of an ever wider conflict, though that frontier was calm Friday.

A visit to Israel by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday, along with shipments of weapons, offered a powerful green light for Israel to drive ahead with its retaliation. Defense Secretary Austin, who met with Israeli leaders Friday, re...

## Students, alumni protest Catholic Diocese of Cleveland’s LGBTQ policy outside Eucharistic Revival Rally

CLEVELAND, Ohio – Dozens of students and alumni from local Catholic schools protested Wednesday against a diocesan policy that critics say restricts the rights of LGBTQ people.

The protest came outside Cleveland Public Auditorium, where Bishop Edward Malesic led a Eucharistic Revival Rally and Mass.

Morning Weather Forecast - 2/28/24

Malesic signed off on the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland policy earlier this fall. It bars students and staff from undergoing gender-affirming care and using pronouns different from those affiliated with a person’s biological sex. It also requires church or school staff members to tell the parents of a child who might be transgender.

The policy pushed the region into a growing nationwide debate regarding religion and LGBTQ issues.

Megan O’Brien, a senior at St. Joseph Academy on Cleveland’s West Side, stood with students, parents and alumni, who balked at the directive.

“The bishop’s new policy is teaching heterosexual and cisgender children to exclude others and just foster hatred,” she said. “It’s teaching LGBTQ children they should just hide themselves and be ashamed of who they are.”

O’Brien, who identifies as bisexual, leads “Academy Inclusion,” the school’s LGBTQ inclusivity and support group for students. She said she was afraid the club would be shut down when she first learned about the policy, but she said the administration at St. Joseph Academy has been supportive of LGBTQ students. The school is run by the Congregation of St. Joseph, and it is independent of the diocese and its policy.

“We’re out here because we have the privilege to be a voice for kids who cannot speak up for themselves who are really devastated by this policy,” she said. “This goes against what the Congregation of Saint Joseph teaches us … that we should serve the dear neighbor.”

In September, Malesic requested all Catholic high school students across the eight-county diocese attend the event, according to an email obtained by cleveland.com and Th...

## Appleton, WI: Community holds vigil for Palestine

By staff

Appleton, WI – On the evening of Friday, December 15, the community held a vigil for the Palestinian martyrs of the ongoing genocide. The event came in the wake of the grim milestone of over 19,000 Palestinians murdered by the U.S.-funded and armed Israeli regime since October 7.

Local organizers and faith leaders gave speeches, led prayers, and read poems to over 50 community members in Appleton’s City Park. The speakers stood in front of an elegant banner that proclaimed “Honor the martyrs. Victory to Palestine.”

The Green Bay Anti-War Committee, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and Oshkosh Student Socialist Association organized the vigil.

FRSO’s Mary Blackburn began by calling on everyone to take motivation from the valiant resistance of the Palestinian liberation movement, as well as from the people all over the world mobilizing for a free Palestine.

Green Bay activist and Palestinian American Reema Abusalma held a moment of silence before asking those present to take extra time to appreciate their loved ones and relative security, but also to use their position to continue public advocacy for Palestine and to participate in the boycott, divest and sanction movement. A member of the nearby mosque led the crowd in prayer, first in Arabic, then English, before a Palestinian community member read a moving poem.

The somber occasion began with a police officer confronting the organizers, who stood firm, and the officer left the scene. Attendees lit their candles and carried on with no further interruptions.

## Rallies Held In Oklahoma City And Tulsa In Response To TPS Accreditation Vote

No matter what side of the issue people were on, everyone wanted TPS students to feel supported and know their education matters.

By: News On 6

Many people went to Oklahoma City on Thursday morning to give their opinions about the district's accreditation status. Several folks held rallies in Tulsa as well.

No matter what side of the issue people were on, everyone wanted TPS students to feel supported and know their education matters.

Breanne Cannon came from Yukon to show her support for Walters. Cannon said she stands with him because she thinks he's trying to improve districts across the state.

"It's actually very disappointing and it's schools across Oklahoma. We are 49th in education in the U.S. I think there's always steps you can take to fix education so we can learn more. And if there's a problem that's been notified, why not take steps to solve it? We can fight it all we want and even if people say there's not much of a problem, why can't we do more to help to try and make things better," Cannon said.

Meanwhile back in Tulsa, students, teachers and parents gathered at different schools, like Nathan Hale High to show their support for TPS.

Emily Hall is a graduate and now a parent to a TPS student. She said she came to the rally to show support for her child and the other students.

"I received an incredible education from Tulsa Public Schools. Children are walking into schools everyday across our city with educators that love them, that show joy, that care about their future. To be a part of showing students, of showing that we care about them and to see that response hopefully goes a long way with them," Hall said.

While they might disagree about who should lead, people who stood outside on Thursday all said they want to see Tulsa Public Schools succeed.

TPS put out a statement thanking the board for its decision. The district said it is committed to ...

## Pro-Palestine protesters disrupt Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade, glue themselves to street

Pro-Palestinian protesters were taken into custody in New York City on Thursday as they attempted to disrupt the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to news reports.

About 30 protesters jumped barricades, ran into the street and apparently glued themselves to Sixth Avenue, which is part of the parade route, WABC reported.

The protesters poured red liquid over themselves as they chanted the slogan “liberation for Palestine and planet,” the Messenger reported.

“Many of them wore tops emblazoned with “Stop the Genocide” as they unfurled a banner saying “Free Palestine,” “Land Back” and “Genocide Then, Genocide Now,” Reuters reported. “Officers led off the protesters, clasped in zip ties.”

The parade was halted for several minutes as police responded to the incident but then resumed.

The parade is in its 97th year....

## New Christian ministry coffee shop protested against over anti-homosexuality stance

DENVER — A new Christian coffee shop in Denver is the target of a protest over the ministry’s stance on homosexuality issues.

Jamie Sanchez, owner of The Drip Café, said he opened the coffee shop in the Santa Fe Arts District for a purpose.

"Our parent company, Recycled God's Love, has been helping the homeless since 2012," said Sanchez, who formed the company with his late wife and his sister. "[The café] is part of our project to provide jobs and funding for the homeless community coming out of homelessness."

Recent Stories from denver7.com

Inside the cafe, Ephesians 4:32 is painted on the wall. "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."

"Our whole point is to love everybody," said Sanchez.

On opening day, several protesters gathered outside. They claim the company's views on the LGBTQ+ community sends the exact opposite message.

"Many people, I believe, would not support it knowing the people behind it and knowing what they have said," said Joseph Turner, who stood outside the café with signs.

Until recently, the website for Recycle God's Love had this to say about their stance on homosexuality:

"This organization is opposed to homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle. Additionally, this organization holds that a homosexual lifestyle is contrary to God's Word and purpose for humanity (I Timothy 1:10). The Bible instructs that it is a sin that leads to death. Moreover, this organization is instructed to love those living such lifestyles, while abhorring their sin. 1 Cor. 6:9 says the following: "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders." Members of the church are forbidden to practice such sin. Any member found to be in such sin and unrepentant shall be subject to dismissal."

"That just really showcases their absolute, just, anti-queerness. How they won'...

## Anti-war protesters target Vergennes weapons facility to call for cease-fire in Gaza

About 50 protestors block the entrances to the Collins Aerospace facility in Vergennes during a shift change to demand a stop to sending arms to Israel and a ceasefire in the war in Gaza on Monday. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger

VERGENNES — Dozens of protesters gathered at a Vermont weapons manufacturing complex on Monday afternoon to demand that the United States government stop arming the Israeli government and call for a permanent cease-fire in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

The demonstration coincided with a shift change at the Vergennes Collins Aerospace weapons manufacturing facility, a subsidiary of the defense contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies.

Waving Palestinian flags and banners that said “Stop Arming Genocide” and “Stop The War Machine,” among other things, protesters blocked the facility’s three entrances to prevent new personnel from entering the building in an attempt to shut down production for the afternoon.

The demonstration took place just over 100 days into the Israel-Hamas war, as Israeli forces continue their assault on the Gaza Strip, which so far has killed over 24,000 Palestinians and displaced about 2 million. Israel launched the offensive in response to a Hamas attack on Oct. 7 in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage.

Amidst the ongoing bombardment and concerns about disease and famine, South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide in a case currently being heard by the International Court of Justice. Protesters Monday echoed that charge and argued that Collins Aerospace and its parent company, RTX, are complicit for providing weapons to Israel, chanting slogans like “F-16s and F-35s, Raytheon profits from Genocide.”

## ‘Bring Mila home’: Supporters rally for North Texas parents whose baby was taken after a hospital visit

"Bring Mila home."

The chant rang out through the parking lot of the Department of Family and Protective Services office in Dallas Thursday as Temecia and Rodney Jackson visited their newborn daughter Mila, who just weeks earlier was taken by Child Protective Services.

Mila was born at home under the care of a midwife and later taken from the Jacksons after a routine postpartum hospital visit, during which the newborn was diagnosed with jaundice, according to family statements and court documents.

Local advocates with The Afiya Center, a nonprofit supporting Black reproductive rights, held the protest Thursday afternoon in hopes of convincing the state to give the Jacksons custody of their daughter after they say she was wrongfully taken away.

"This baby, who was born to a family who invested their money and their time into hiring a licensed midwife to have a legal and safe home birth in a state where home birth is legal — they are being punished because this family chose to act on their rights and use their midwife to continue their baby's health care," Qiana Lewis-Arnold, birth justice associate with the Afiya Center, said Thursday.

The Jacksons delivered Mila with the help of a midwife about two weeks ago and got a check-up from the family's pediatrician three days later. That’s when the family heard the jaundice diagnosis.

Severe cases of jaundice, left untreated, pose a risk of brain damage, according to the Mayo Clinic.

A doctor with Baylor Scott and White advised they return to the hospital to treat Mila's condition. But the Jacksons decided to care for Mila at home with their midwife.

Concerned the family and midwife wouldn’t perform the recommended phototherapy treatment correctly, the doctor — Anand Bhatt — threatened to alert CPS if they did not admit the newborn to the hospital.

The Jacksons didn’t. Bhatt, in his letter to DFPS, called the family “very loving” and said “they care dearly about their baby,” but said their “distrust for medical car...

## Tyre Nichols video prompts outrage, peaceful protest in Dallas

As the city braced for protests following the release of video showing the fatal beating of a Black man by Memphis police, several dozen people gathered in Dallas for an impassioned but peaceful demonstration.

Footage released Friday evening depicts in harrowing detail the Jan. 7 traffic stop and beating that left Tyre Nichols hospitalized in critical condition. It shows officers viciously attacking the 29-year-old, who can be heard screaming repeatedly for his mom.

Nichols died three days later.

The officers, who are all Black, were arrested on charges including second-degree murder. They were fired last week.

About an hour after the release of the video Friday evening, roughly two dozen people had gathered outside the Dallas Police Department headquarters south of downtown Dallas for a scheduled protest, but organizers of the demonstration said people needed more time to watch the footage.

Some attendees held signs with sayings including “Stop the war on Black America” and “Justice for Tyre Nichols.” Crowding together against the cold, they shouted “No justice, no peace” and “No good cops in a racist system.”

“We’re still seeing this stuff happen again,” said Irfan Sattar, who lives in Dallas and has family in Memphis. “It’s uncalled for. America is supposed to be a great country. We’re a great country, let’s showcase it.”

## Students rally for LGBTQ support, improved services at University of Louisville

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Dozens of students at the University of Louisville protested against Kentucky Senate Bill 150 on Thursday, urging the university to improve services for LGBTQ students.

The newly-passed bill bans gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of 18, and prevents school lessons about gender and sexuality before the sixth grade. SB 150 also requires students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender at birth.

Students want to see university leadership condemn the law, and are pushing for other changes to support the LGBTQ community on campus. Those changes include increased mental health and gender-affirming care providers on campus, funding of the campus LGBT Center, and improvements to campus housing policies.

"We want the Board of Trustees to realize that our demands are overwhelmingly popular across the campus," said rally organizer Andy Rozema. "Specifically, our demands are to fix the housing issues on campus, condemn Senate Bill 150, increase funding for queer counseling, and increase the number of providers that do gender-affirming care on campus."

The group took a petition with 1,000 signatures to a Board of Trustees meeting Thursday afternoon.

"Despite 1,000 signatures on an open letter (including 138 faculty) demanding the University of Louisville support LGBTQ students following SB 150, the University remains silent," organizers said in a news release prior to Thursday's rally.

UofL said in a statement that it has requested increased funding for student support services, provided key training in transgender issues, and has started making changes to its housing procedures to ensure fairness to all students.

Officials said the university supports all of its LGBTQ students.

You can read UofL's full statement below:

## 'Police the Police' demonstrators call for charges as CT traffic ticket scandal unfolds

Protesters at a “Police the Police” demonstration outside the Connecticut state Capitol on Tuesday called for officers involved in falsifying thousands of traffic tickets to be held accountable.

“They claim there’s no racial bias, but we know there’s racial bias,” said Abimbola “King” Oretade, president of Black Lives Matter 860 in Hartford. “We’ve been noticing police officers pull over more Black and brown [drivers] than other races, and it’s so bad you can see they had to fake a whole lot of tickets. So we want the police officers and whoever had anything to do with that to be under review and suspended until further notice.”

At the rally, Oretade said that officers involved should face prison time.

“Treat them just like a civilian, just like us," Oretade said, further stating that officers had falsified documentation. "If I falsify documentation, I'm looking at felony charges. That's not a lie.”

The demonstration was held just under a month after the release of an audit by analysts at the University of Connecticut, one day after Gov. Ned Lamont appointedConnecticut'sformer U.S. Attorney to conduct an independent review into the findings, and one day before Connecticut State Police and Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection officials were scheduled to testify about the matter at a public hearing .

The audit from the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project at UConn’s Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy found troopers falsified at least 26,000 tickets from 2014 through 2021, skewing reports on the race and ethnicity of pulled-over motorists.

“I have great faith in the overwhelming majority of our troopers, and to protect public confidence in them we must get to the bottom of this and learn how it happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from ever happening again,” Lamont said in a statement.

Connecticut State Police Col. Stavros Mellekas said in a statement that he had ordered his troopers to cooperate with the formal...

## UPS employees rally in Steelton

HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) – Time’s running out for UPS to reach an agreement with its unionized workers. Rallies have been taking place all over the country in support.

If the UPS International Teamsters and UPS don’t come to an agreement by July 31st, 340,000 UPS employees will go on strike.

“We’re going to fight’em and were not going to stop,” someone said during the rally.

On Wednesday, dozens of UPS employees, community members and some government officials were at USW Hall in Steelton for a rally in support of UPS International Teamsters in their fight for better wages and working conditions.

Especially part-time employees, which makes up about 55% of the UPS workforce.

“We have part-timers who are homeless, we have part-timers who are on public assistance, we have single mothers trying to take care of families,” said International Teamsters Secretary Treasurer Fred Zuckerman.

Justin Seitz has been an employee at UPS for 16 years and this is his 4th time going through negotiations.

Seitz said, “It’s time for change, the workers want better working conditions……We come to work every day, we give our all, they strive off of our hard work.”

UPS delivers 25 million packages a day and since COVID profits have tripled.

“Making work extremely busy for all of you, back breaking work, that you do in brutal conditions and make barely 20-dollars an hour,” someone said during the rally.

State Rep. Mark Rozzi (D-Berks) was marching at the rally with his community to send a message to President Biden.

“My fear is that if the president steps in and tries to push both sides of just to come to a deal that the workers of this country would not get a fair deal,” Rozzi said.

If the hundreds of thousands of UPS employees go on strike, people will feel the impact.

“I know that a lot of people really depend on online purchasing for everything from basic household needs, to presents, to all kinds of things,” said Penn ...

## Citizens hold ‘read-in’ in protest of book-banning bills

BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - More than 200 people gathered outside the Bismarck Veterans Memorial Library Thursday evening in protest of legislation aimed at keeping certain books off library shelves.

It may have been quiet outside the Bismarck Veterans Memorial Library, but the people who gathered here for a “read-in” are hoping their presence and silence speaks volumes.

“Well, I just don’t think it’s right that government, church, individual or group should be allowed to tell me what I can and cannot read or what books I have access to,” said Penny Lind of Bismarck.

This quiet but passionate crowd wants lawmakers at the capitol to know exactly how they feel about two bills aimed at taking what some consider inappropriate books off of library shelves.

The idea of a read-in to draw attention to the cause only made sense to event planners.

“So, a read-in, I mean there’s a lot of tradition you think of sit-ins you think of different ways that people can show their unhappiness with things that might be going on in their government and policies. So, a read-in just felt perfect for a library,” said Beth Schatz Kaylor, who organized the event.

Kaylor said she knows there are many people around the state who support their stance as more read-ins are planned at libraries around the region. She said she hopes this event helps representatives understand these bills would cause ripple effects they may not be aware of.

No one who supported House Bill 1205 or Senate Bill 2360 attended the read-in. However, some proponents of this legislations have been very vocal about their support of it during the legislative session.

## Protesters rally in Indianola after 11-year-old shot in chest by officer

INDIANOLA, Miss. (WJTV) – An Indianola family demanded justice after an 11-year-old was shot in the chest allegedly by a police officer.

A rally was held outside of Indianola City Hall on Thursday, May 25. Attorney Carlos Moore called for the city to take action after 11-year-old Aderrien Murry was shot.

Bailey Martin, press secretary for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety (DPS), said the officer-involved shooting happened around 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, May 20 at a home on BB King Road.

Indianola police were responding to a domestic disturbance at the home when the shooting happened, according to Martin.

Nakala Murry, the boy’s mother, said police were called to the house because the boy’s father came over and was acting irate. When he acted this way, she knew something could potentially happen and wanted “to stop it right there.” She snuck her phone to her son and asked him to call her mother and the police.

Moore called for the termination of Officer Greg Capers and Chief Ronald Sampson. He said Murry was shot in the chest by Capers.

The attorney also called for the release of body camera footage of the incident, which has not been released by the Indianola Police Department.

“We gave you 48 hours to do the right thing. We told you on Monday evening that if you did not immediately terminate Greg Capers, we would be here,” stated Moore during the rally.

The attorney also requested assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice in the case.

Moore said Murry is recovering from his injury at home. Capers has been suspended with pay from the department.

Agents with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI) are investigating the officer-involved shooting. Once their investigation has been completed, they will share their findings with the Attorney General’s Office....

## Textron building wrapped in plastic ahead of planned protest

Textron building wrapped in plastic ahead of planned protest

This is a photo of plastic placed on the Textron building before a planned protest in Providence. (WLNE)

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — The Textron building on Westminster Street in Providence was seen wrapped in plastic the night before a planned protest in support of Palestine in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

ABC 6 News crews were on the scene where plastic could be seen on the building’s front side as well as caution tape.

This comes before a protest, planned by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, is scheduled to take to the streets of downtown Providence on Thursday between noon and 4 p.m.

Last week, the Textron building was vandalized twice with red paint and phrases that read “Free Palestine” and “Kills Kids.”

Two RISD students were charged and pleaded not guilty in connection to the vandalism on November 2....

## ‘Rent is Too Damn High’ coalition calls Sept. 5 rally at Michigan Capitol

Housing activists with the Rent is Too Damn High Coalition are preparing for a Sept. 5 rally at the Michigan State Capitol. | Images via Rent is Too Damn High

LANSING, Mich.—A statewide coalition known as “Rent is Too Damn High” will descend on Michigan State Capitol on Sept. 5 to protest escalating costs of housing in the state. According to the coalition’s press coordinator, Lindsey Barchard, well over 600 people had pledged to join the protest at the capitol by early August.

The Sept. 5 rally will include a DJ, chanting and marching, spoken word poetry, multiple speakers, and an area for people to share their own housing stories. “Our plan for the 5th is to make as much noise as possible,” Bachard said, “to convey to the legislators the sheer volume of Michigan’s residents who are becoming increasingly desperate for change.”

Rents in Michigan have grown rapidly over the past few years as urban gentrification projects have been offered as the main solution for economic woes. According to recent media reports, a typical renter in 2023 must earn an average of $21.65 per hour to afford basic housing in the state.

The state’s minimum wage, however, remains locked in at a paltry $10.10 per hour, and the “tipped” hourly minimum is $3.84. In addition, an anachronistic statewide ban on rent control has also fueled skyrocketing housing costs.

The Rent is Too Damn High rally will “raise awareness and put pressure on lawmakers to take action to address the full-blown housing crisis in our state,” Barchard said.

Sept. 5 was chosen because it will be the first day of the state’s new legislative session. Democrats, who control both houses and the governor’s office, promised to solve the state’s ongoing housing problems when they took power in 2023. Activists intend to hold them to their pledge.

Coalition leaders are calling for three major steps to ease the costs of housing:

1) Remove the ban on rent control;

2) Put $4 billion toward “social housing”; and

3) Designate...

## Students plan protest to rally support for N.J.’s oldest college Africana Studies program

Seton Hall University students are planning to walk out of class at noon Wednesday to protest what they say is a lack of support from the school for the Africana Studies program.

The group, called the Protect AFAM Movement, says the program has no tenured professors and it is impossible for students to complete Africana Studies majors or minors.

The Protect AFAM Movement is asking the Catholic university to: hire three or four full-time professors; reinstate Africana Studies as a department by next spring; appoint a full-time tenured director for the program; and allow students to serve as search committee liaisons with voting power for hiring.

“The program’s only full-time professor and program director was forced out of the university, and our administration has failed to recognize the severity and urgency of the situation,” reads part of the group’s statement. “The lack of fundamental resources and professors has made it impossible for students to fulfill majors and minors in Africana Studies.”

University officials have delayed posting a job advertisement for a new tenured professor for the program, the group alleged. The university has also restricted students from providing verbal feedback on candidates and required them to sign nondisclosure agreements.

Students previously expressed concerns about the program.

In 2018, a group called the Concerned 44 organized a protest at President’s Hall, occupying the space on the South Orange campus for multiple days. The protest resulted in “answers to some of their demands, but none of the promises from university have seen meaningful longevity,” according to a statement from the Protect AFAM Movement.

In a statement, a Seton Hall spokesperson said the university has heard the students’ concerns and permits peaceful, non-obstructive student demonstrations on campus.

“We have continued to listen carefully and consider the requests of Concerned 44 while engaging in dialogue about the steps that will most effectivel...

## GWU students protest armed officers

Student protest outside F Street House, the residence of the president of GWU, following the announcement that the university will soon arm some of its police officers.

Around 150 students and community members protested George Washington University’s decision to begin arming campus police officers, marching on Monday afternoon to F Street House, the residence of GWU president Mark S. Wrighton, with signs reading, “We keep us safe” and “Guns ≠ public safety.”

Wrighton announced last Thursday that some members of the university’s police force will begin carrying firearms. He cited increasing gun violence at institutions across the country, including recent shootings at Michigan State University, the University of Virginia and the Covenant School, an elementary school in Nashville. He noted that only certain “highly qualified supervisory officers” who have received formal police academy training and specialized firearms training will be armed.

Most Popular Stories Most Popular

In addition to the protest, 20 student organizations signed a statement decrying the announcement and arguing that arming police officers will only lead to increased violence, particularly against students of color.

“The vast majority of instances in which GWPD is called to action are to resolve conflicts and pacify intoxicated students,” the statement read. “If GWPD is responsible for protecting students’ safety on campus, they would have the capacity for de-escalation practices. The decision to arm campus police with threatening weapons with no regard for the input of students, parents, or faculty should not be taken lightly. By GWPD’s own reports, they detained only 12 people on campus in 2022, none of whom were carrying weapons or contraband. The presence of guns on campus can only put students at risk of gun violence.”...

## Nurses, staff members rally at Seton Medical Center

Nurses and staff members held separate rallies at Seton Medical Center in Daly City on Tuesday morning, calling for decisions to cut jobs to be overturned and for their benefits to be increased.

Staff members were told Friday that 33 jobs will be cut by AHMC Healthcare, the hospital's owner, next month, according to Matthew Artz, a spokesperson for the National Union of Healthcare Workers.

"AHMC is the worst operator we've ever seen at Seton," Christina Caradis, a radiologic technologist who has worked at the hospital for 26 years, said in a press release. "They're not able to provide basic needs for the hospital or patients."

Caradis also said the hospital has outdated technology that doesn't work and machines that have not been fixed.

"I take pride in serving my community, but it's heartbreaking to witness the decline of our hospital and the impact it has on patients," she added.

"They are taking away the good insurance we had for our families and making us pay more," said John Paes, a respiratory therapist at Seton for 26 years. "There are a lot of departments that are closed, so how are we expected to get proper service for our own families."

Paes said AHMC started slowly cutting back hours for many departments, which led to doctors no longer ordering necessary procedures, which he says is a way to cut other staff members out.

He added that he felt patients' lives are at stake because AHMC has allegedly not repaired EKG machines and ventilators that aren't working.

The California Nurses Association said AHMC Healthcare, based in Alhambra in Southern California, is rushing the implementation of a new medical plan they say is inferior to what Seton nurses currently have.

Nurses also criticized the owners and administration, saying the job cuts could not come at a worse time for them despite the company seeing $42 million in profit last year, according to the union.

"We have to fight for our job security because they're laying off people," said nursing as...

## Protestors seek apology from MPD, firing of officers in wrongful arrest case

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Justice for Jamil.

A Memphis family says their loved one was wrongly arrested by police. They want an apology from the Memphis Police Department, and that’s not the only demand made during a protest on Friday.

At the corner of Poplar Avenue and Highland Street, protestors shouted: “Justice for Jamil” and “Whose city? Our city!”

Supporters said they want charges dropped against Jamil Ibrahim, a man who was arrested May 27 after he called Memphis police to report he’d found a bag of bullets behind his business.

The responding officer, said family members, mistook Ibrahim for a wanted man.

”He told them there’s no warrant for arrest on his behalf,” said protestor Nabil Bayakly, “and she kept on insisting there is warrant for his arrest, and he kept insisting, no, it wasn’t him, she was making a mistake.”

Ibrahim and three of his brothers were arrested after an altercation when other officers arrived on the scene.

Protestors accused MPD of police brutality. Ibrahim, they said, still has stitches, bruises, and injuries from the incident.

On Tuesday, June 6, the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office dismissed charges against the three brothers. Ibrahim still faces two counts of misdemeanor assault on a first responder.

“Frankly, based on our staff’s review of the video and what we have found so far,” said Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, “we have some concerns about both Mr. Ibrahim’s behavior in the altercation, and also the arresting officers’ behavior.”

DA Mulroy says MPD Chief CJ Davis told him an internal investigation is now underway.

Protestors said not only do they want an apology from Chief Davis, but they also want the six officers involved to be fired.

“We need to get the community out here to know that police brutality is real,” said Bayakly. “Police brutality is alive in this city. And it’s going after minorities of all types. This must stop. And the police must protect and serve.”

## Mothers rally as republican lawmakers call for hearings on 2 gun bills

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - More than a hundred mothers and grandmothers gathered and expressed their anger and frustration with state lawmakers who said they refused to pass common-sense gun safety laws.

As Republican lawmakers called for hearings on two new gun bills, on Tuesday at noon, a group of moms held a rally on Capitol Hill demanding their voices be heard and that legislators pass meaningful gun safety laws to protect children in their schools and on the streets.

“Why are we as adults not protecting them?” said a person who attended spoke at the rally. “Why are legislators not protecting them?”

People who attended the rally for Moms Demand Action wore red shirts and held signs in protest.

“These continue to just happen over and over again,” Axtell said. “It’s like getting punched in the gut.”

One solution that has been spread around is the idea of arming teachers to protect students in possible future cases where school mass shootings occur.

“This idea of bringing more guns into our community, more guns onto our campuses that will murder our children is somehow a solution to our problem…it’s obscene,” said Amanda Rosenberger with Moms Demand Action.

In the wake of Monday’s deadly shooting at The Covenant School in the Green Hills area, many are saying words and prayers are no longer enough.

“I stand with all of us as we have thoughts and prayers, but prayers without action is useless,” A person who attended the rally said.

Many of those who attended the rally want to keep tragedies like Monday’s school shooting in West Nashville from happening again.

“It’s when you see the faces of those children and you see your own grandchildren’s faces. It’s just too real and too close and we’ve got to make changes,” said Janie Luna, another person at the rally.

The hearings on the two new gun bills were postponed to April 4. Leaders with Moms Demand Action said they will be there rallying again for common sense gun safety measures.

## Students’ rights organizations holding book ban protest outside DCPS headquarters

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Public School Defenders announced that it will hold a rally on Monday to call for an end to book bans in Florida.

>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<

The organization will be joined by Florida Freedom to Read, Families for Strong Public Schools, Rebel Readers, 904ward, Equality Florida and Moms Rising.

The rally is being held in response to Florida state laws that give parents stronger challenging power over books in school libraries. Public School Defenders believes the increased power is being weaponized by a small number of parents.

The rally is meant to protest the book banning while defending student’s “right to access information and ideas while at school.”

Protestors are meeting in front of Duval County Public Schools Headquarters at 5:30 p.m. Action News Jax’s Robert Grant will be there to get you the latest information.

## Community condemns recent acts of hate at Fairfax Co. Pride rally

This article is about 8 months old

FCPS Pride organized a rally for all communities in Fairfax County schools, which happened on the same night the school board voted to proclaim June as LGBTQIA+ Pride Month.

A group that included Virginia Del. Marcus Simon, Fairfax County Public School teachers and students and members of the organization FCPS Pride gathered Thursday night before a school board meeting to condemn recent acts of hate in county schools.

FCPS Pride organized the event, a “Pride Rally Against Hate” for all communities in county schools, on the same night the board voted to proclaim June as LGBTQIA+ Pride Month in the school system.

The proclamation later passed 11-0, with Board Member Abrar Omeish abstaining.

The group used Thursday’s event to speak out about two recent hate incidents on school campuses.

In one incident at Falls Church High School, a student admitted stealing a Pride flag from school grounds and then burning it, according to a message shared with the school community. The incident was caught on video, and “another young person is heard using homophobic and hate-filled language toward the LGBTQ+ community,” the message said.

“This is not the kind of school community we seek to cultivate,” Principal Ben Nowak wrote in the message sent out last week.

In another incident at West Potomac High, someone left homophobic and antisemitic messages on the school’s “spirit rock.” The messages were discovered as the school convened for its Class of 2023 graduation.

“To see these symbols of hate at the space that welcomes others to our school is devastating,” Principal Tanga...

## SJP organizes candlelight vigil for Palestinian victims of the violence in Gaza

On Wednesday, Dec. 6, The New School’s chapter of Students For Justice in Palestine (SJP) continued their Week of Action by hosting a candlelight vigil in the Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts Courtyard. It began at 4 p.m. and lasted for roughly an hour as about 40 students, faculty, and alumni gathered to honor the Palestinian lives lost in Gaza. The vigil comes a day after a contentious walkout also organized by SJP.

Around 100 small battery-powered candles lined the stone stairs on the edge of the Lang Courtyard, and a large Palestinian flag hung from barren trees behind the steps. Phrases like “within our lifetime” and “never again for anyone” along with several names were written in colorful chalk between the rows of candles.

At 4:04 p.m., a group of faculty members from TNS Faculty in Justice for Palestine (FJP) arrived, one with a bouquet of flowers which she placed in front of the candles. A projector was positioned to the left of the candles, displaying a presentation for the duration of the vigil. The opening screen depicted three simple yet emotionally charged sketches of desperate embraces with the words “60 days, and 75 years of occupation” typed in green above.

At 4:20 p.m., the vigil officially began as conversations among the crowd hushed and attention was directed to a member of SJP for an opening statement. They said, “We gather here in order to acknowledge an unspeakable loss of life. We gather because a movement that separates itself from the full breadth of human emotion is not a movement that will last. We gather because those in Gaza have no choice but to face what they’re going through.”

Throughout the vigil, a rolling list of names of fallen Gazans remained projected on the 12th Street wall of the Lang Courtyard. The names were sorted by age, noted in parentheses, beginning with 0 years old.

The president of the Jewish Culture Club, Ramona Saft, was also am...

## Locals protest LGBTQ+ flag hanging outside Biloxi VA Medical Center

BILOXI, Miss. (WLOX) - Protesters joined forces in front of the Biloxi VA Medical Center on Monday to speak up against an LGBTQ+ flag that hangs outside the front gate.

The VA put the two rainbow flags on display alongside American flags on June 1 to commemorate Pride Month. A letter from Mississippi’s Congressional leaders is asking the Veterans Affairs secretary to take down the flags, saying they promote a political statement.

Vietnam War veteran Richard Boyanton was among the protesters. He says it’s wrong for an American Flag to be replaced with an LGBTQ+ flag.

“I can’t imagine that people would think this is alright,” Boyanton said. “We don’t need a flag for each nationality or each different group of people. The American flag represents everyone.”

The other flag that hung on the east side of the entrance was removed twice by someone outside of the VA’s organization.

“We’re completely discouraged that someone took the avenue of vandalism to express their concerns and beliefs,” said Shaun Shenk, the VA’s chief of community and public affairs.

VA leaders say 1 million veterans nationwide identify as LGBTQ+.

Shenk says the organization’s goal is to create a more welcoming environment for veterans while providing them with good health care.

“Veterans fought for the right to demonstrate the freedom of speech, and VA supports that,” he said. “The point of VA is to take care of those exact veterans and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that we’re providing pathways for all veterans through all diversities.”

Boyanton said he and his fellow protesters won’t stop until the flags are no more.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — A group of students and teachers at 360 High School in Providence took their protest over a planned merger with Juanita Sanchez Educational Complex to the Rhode Island State House Friday.

A larger student-led walk-out earlier in the week was prompted by the threat that the teachers at the school would not be included in the merger.

A spokesman for Providence Public Schools said the change was prompted by 360 High being an underperforming school.

The district added that teachers at the school can re-apply for other positions in the district.

The schools are planned to merge at the end of the school year....

## Armenians protest Turkish Ambassador’s presence on campus

Armenian students and residents of Los Angeles, home to the largest Armenian diaspora, protested the presence of the U.S. Turkish Ambassador Hasan Murat Mercan at a foreign policy conference on campus Friday. The panel, “Role of Diplomacy in Turkish Foreign Policy” was initially open to all students, but became a high-security affair after protesters were forcibly thrown out of Wallis Annenberg Hall and access to the event was restricted.

Several dozen demonstrators held up signs with red handprints, chanting “USC supports terrorists,” and “genocidal policy has no place in diplomacy,” along with other phrases critical of the Turkish government. The protestors could be heard inside the conference room at the event, organized by students and held at the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism.

Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said USC stands by its choice to hold the event due to their Policy on Free Speech at USC.

“We have certainly received emails expressing concerns about this event and asking us to cancel this event,” Bay said. “Our hearts go out to all our Armenian students.”

A video taken by one of the student protestors shows DPS officers escorting students out of the conference room. Once outside, DPS officers clashed with students trying to regain entry to the conference. The group of demonstrators was not limited to the USC Armenian Student Association, as members of the greater Los Angeles Armenian diaspora also joined the protest.

The protestors said they are outraged by recent events in the Lachin corridor, the only road connecting the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region with their homeland. The road has been blocked by Turkish-supported Azerbaijani military forces, leaving hundreds wounded and dozens dead due to a lack of food, medicine and other essentials.

The Nagorno-Karabakh region, known by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, is in sovereign Azerbaijan. Over 93,000 ethnic Armenians have fled since Azerbaijan opened the L...

## Pro-Palestinian marchers harass weeping Israel supporter at NYC demonstration: ‘Burn in hell!’

No serenity for Jerry Seinfeld as he’s berated by anti-Israel protesters outside NYC event: video

Pro-Palestinian protesters in Brooklyn swarmed a weeping woman holding an Israeli flag Saturday — forcing cops to protect her as the crowd screamed vicious insults.

The hateful incident took place during the “Flood Brooklyn for Gaza” protest, which drew an estimated 5,000 demonstrators to the Brooklyn Museum for a march that took them to Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Bridge, and City Hall.

Marchers bore Palestinian flags and signs bearing aggressive messages — including some that appeared to celebrate the Oct. 7 terror attack that killed at least 1,200 Israeli civilians and took hundreds more hostage.

“I’m glad Zionists are scared and crying,” one placard read. “The wicked shall never rest peacefully.”

As the demonstrators marched along High St. toward the bridge — chanting slogans such as “Israel we know you, you kill babies too” — they spotted the young female counter-protester outside an apartment building on the sidewalk opposite, silently holding an Israeli flag in her hands.

A group of about 15 marchers broke off from the crowd and rushed across the road to confront her.

A brief tug-of-war ensued as some tried unsuccessfully to rip the flag from her grasp, while others shouted, “Burn in hell!”

Half a dozen police officers dashed to her aid, forming a phalanx around the crying woman and separating her from the group.

“Say what you need to say and back up,” one cop told the marchers, who returned to their places in the crowd.

No arrests were made, police said, and the procession cont...

## Overturning of Roe offers new beginning for pro-life efforts, Arlington bishop says at National Prayer Vigil for Life

The standing room crowd of more than 6,000 people from across the United States attending the Jan. 19 opening Mass for the National Prayer Vigil for Life at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception offered a visible sign of pro-life advocates’ determination to continue to pray, march and work for life in the year after the Supreme Court in its June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision overturned the court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion on demand for nearly five decades.

The crowd including many young families with children, college students and teens filled the Great Upper Church of the largest Catholic church in North America, with an overflow crowd watching the Mass in the basilica’s Memorial Hall on its lower level. The Mass was televised nationally and around the world by EWTN, the Eternal World Television Network.

The annual National Prayer Vigil for Life, which began in 1979, takes place on the evening before the March for Life, which began in the aftermath of the Roe v. Wade ruling and which this year held its 50th march with a new focus since that Supreme Court decision is no longer the law of the land, and states can now pass abortion restrictions.

Arlington Bishop Michael F. Burbidge, the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Pro-Life Activities, was the main celebrant and homilist at the opening Mass for the National Prayer Vigil for Life, and as he began his homily, he reflected on how this is a new moment, and a ne...

## LaFayette protests at the BOE meeting - Valley Times-News

LaFayette protests at the BOE meeting Published 8:00 am Thursday, September 28, 2023

The chanting of “No equity, no peace” was once again the background anthem to the Chambers County School District’s board meeting on Wednesday night as a crowd stood outside the doors to protest the district’s leadership.

“If you’re not going to be just and equitable, we are not going to be silent any longer,” said LaFayette High School Counselor LaWendy Willis to the board.

LaFayette Teachers Against Displacement held a rally to protest against the board’s decision to build the new consolidated high school in Valley just days after district court judge Keith Watkins released his full ruling, OK’ing the deicion.

Email newsletter signup

In June, Watkins’ order was released, ordering LaFayette High School to stay open while the school district moves forward with building at the Valley site. His written opinion released this week reaffirmed that decision.

“It’s clearly stated in the ruling how the judge felt and ruled. I felt like the ruling was fair, I felt like the ruling was applicable,” said CCSD Superintendent Dr. Casey Chambley. “So we are ready to move forward. We’re hoping and praying that we can find common ground and find a way to move forward for our kids because that’s ultimately who all of this is about.”

The group has held several protests since January. This was the second rally at the board central office, the first of which was in August.

Unite Founder Dr. Travis Smith said that they will continue to attend board meetings until they see change. He also said Chambley has contradicted himself about the reasons for not using school sites along Highway 50.

“The mission hasn’t changed. We’re going to continue to bring awareness to some of the major issues,” Smith said.

During the board meeting, Willis addressed the board with concerns about the qualifications of teachers hired this year, questioning the ethics in the hiring process.

“Who is hiring the educators f...

## ‘It’s time for change’: Protest in Ocala after formal charges filed in Ajike Owens case

OCALA, Fla. (WCJB) - Charges have been formally filed against a woman from Ocala accused of shooting and killing her neighbor this month.

Around twenty people met outside the Marion County Judicial Center in Downtown Ocala Monday afternoon, protesting the formal charges filed by State Attorney Bill Gladson against Susan Lorincz.

“This here is unjust, people of colors have been having this done to them for 500 years now,” said protester Larry Johnson. “It’s time for it to stop and it’s time for a change.”

Lorincz is accused of shooting her neighbor Ajike ‘AJ’ Owens through the front door during an argument about Owens’ kids on June 2.

Those supporting Owens wanted Lorincz’ charges to be upgraded to second degree murder, but Gladson said there was not enough evidence to prove that. Instead, he dropped Lorincz’s battery, assault, and culpable negligence charges.

Protestors encouraged people to get informed about politics and get ready to vote for elected positions like state attorney.

“Vote these people out of office. They mean us no good, their laws are harmful to our communities, and it’s time for them to go,” said protester Cassandra Brown.

Gladson explained in a statement he dropped the misdemeanor charges based on testimonies and the facts of the case.

A protester told TV20 he knew Ajike for more than ten years, so he is doing what he can to help seek justice for her family.

“I just need to be out here and be a speaker, a listener, just let the family know we’re with them and we’re riding with them and it’s just time,” said Jaye Jones.

Lorincz is held at the Marion County Jail on a 154-thousand dollar bond.

## While North Carolina gambling opponents rally, Republicans weigh whether to embrace more casinos

While North Carolina gambling opponents rally, Republicans weigh whether to embrace more casinos

North Carolina General Assembly

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — As North Carolina House members met privately over whether to authorize more gambling in the state, social conservatives, business operators and political candidates urged lawmakers on Tuesday to reject efforts to permit more casinos and legalize statewide video gaming machines.

Residents of rural Rockingham, Anson and Nash counties, which have been previously designated by legislators as potential locations for non-tribal casinos as part of “entertainment districts” in a proposal considered by House and Senate Republicans, visited Raleigh to lobby against the idea.

During a news conference outside the Legislative Building, the gambling opponents lamented the lack of public discussion about any gambling proposal. It could end up in the final state budget bill that the General Assembly probably will vote on next week if enough House and Senate Republicans want it there.

Tuesday’s rally of about 50 people holding “Keep Our Community Great” placards contrasted with the gambling interests — and their dozens of lobbyists — who have been very active during this year’s legislative session.

The news conference happened while House Republicans met behind closed doors in a caucus meeting that lasted over three hours. The level of support for casinos, video gambling terminals and other gambling options were among items discussed, Speaker Tim Moore said later Tuesday.

The General Assembly already passed a law in June that authorizes sports gambling starting next year. The state currently has three casinos, operated by two American Indian tribes.

Moore told reporters that his lieutenants were still contacting GOP colleagues to determine whether there are enough votes to move forward on more gambling.

“I want to know where our caucus is, and we just have to have a count, and we don’t have it yet,” Moore told reporters.

## The Daily Targum

Dozens gathered on Thursday to attend a candlelit vigil for victims of state violence, held by various student organizations.

The vigil featured unidentified speakers and later, the floor was opened for the public to voice their thoughts. The first speaker began by naming individuals that died during an Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in Jenin, Palestine.

The second speaker discussed the discrepancies between Indigenous Peruvian's blue-collar work and the lives of the country's metropolitan citizens. They also highlighted the reason why protests are currently occurring in Lima, Peru.

"They don't get the Peru that they're making. They work the land. They make the food. They make the country what it is, but they don't get that at the end of the day," the speaker said.

They said the deaths of Keenan Anderson and Tyre Nichols resulted from the larger issue of policing in the U.S. The speaker concentrated their point on the state’s control over people and private property and questioned the legitimacy of their power.

"It all comes down to ... defending property and ultimately, to upholding the genocide of Indigenous peoples of Peru, the Indigenous peoples of Palestine, of Black Americans here in the U.S.," the speaker said. "Who are not only targeted by racist policing but are also targeted by the military-industrial complex that is using them as free labor and continuing the slave system that has been in this country since the 17th century."

The third speaker reiterated this point when they said state economies, including Arizona, heavily rely on the labor of incarcerated individuals.

Subsequent speakers said they attended this vigil to advocate for the accountability of the U.S. government, the prison industrial complex and governmental policing systems worldwide. All speakers did not state their names when speaking.

Prior to Thursday's gathering, flyers posted around the College Avenue campus, as well as a joint Instagram post from the accounts of the ...

## LGBTQ rights activists protest outside Gov. Cox’s office

SALT LAKE CITY • LGBTQ rights activists staged a demonstration outside Governor Spencer Cox’s office on Friday night, demanding he veto a bill that restricts health care for transgender youth.

“Trans lives are on the line! Governor Cox, please don’t sign!” some chanted.

Senate Bill 16 passed the legislature earlier in the day on its final vote after a series of emotional debates. On Thursday, Gov. Cox told FOX 13 News he was not planning to veto the bill.

Some of the same demonstrators were here in 2019, when they sat outside the governor’s office and demanded action to ban conversion therapy. Then-Lt. Governor Cox promised to help them and an administrative rule was passed that did it (a bill has been introduced in the legislature this year to undo it).

Ermiya Fanaeian said it was “disheartening” to be outside the governor’s office again asking him to protect transgender youth.

“He’s actually been wishy-washy about whether or not he will sign it into law,” Fanaeian said, adding: “He hasn’t been taking a strong stance on protecting trans kids, so I have no hope he will veto. No plan is definitely no plan to protect trans children from the consequences of these bills. So he needs to make a serious and committed stance to veto every single one of these bills as they will have severe consequences and trans kids will in fact, end up dying as a result of them.”

The demonstrators on Friday sat outside the governor’s office for about an hour until the Capitol closed. Utah Highway Patrol troopers stood back and observed. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah was also on hand to ensure the demonstration was peaceful.

## GVSU students hold rally supporting MSU, demanding change

ALLENDALE, Mich. — Grand Valley State University students rallied for change Saturday, following Monday’s deadly mass shooting at Michigan State University, which killed three students and hurt five others.

Students told FOX 17 Saturday that the tragedy could have been prevented.

“I’m just so sick and tired of all of this. It keeps happening and nothing seems to be done about it,” Quinten Proctor, a sophomore at GVSU, said. “I have so many friends from high school that attend MSU. Thankfully, to my knowledge, they are all physically okay, but I cannot even begin to imagine, like, how they’re feeling.”

Proctor says he wants to be there for the Spartan community in any way he can, which included attending Saturday’s rally and demanding change.

“I just want to remind my friends here at Grand Valley, we’re all in this together. Contact your legislators and demand change,” Proctor added.

Some state legislators also attended Saturday’s rally at GVSU, including Congresswoman Hillary Scholten, and state representatives John Fitzgerald and Carol Glanville.

“I was a victim of gun violence about 30 years ago when I was your age,” Representative Glanville explained. “And I know how that feels. To have it sneak up on you at any moment in time. We need to do better. We have folks who have been in our legislature, who were incumbents when Oxford happened and refused to act.”

“It is long past time for real, measurable change because I sit at home with a 10-week-old daughter and I’m not willing to sit by and have another active shooter generation raised in America,” Representative Fitzgerald added.

“I’m here today to tell you that I am going to do everything in my power to keep you safe, to keep something like what happened at Michigan State University from happening right here at Grand Valley,” Congresswoman Scholten said.

GVSU student Nancy Hoogwerf organized the rally. She says they’ve been calling for action for years.

## Climate and labor rights protesters attempt to block APEC entrances

While President Joe Biden was on his way to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday morning at the Filoli estate in Woodside, protesters gathered outside the Powell Street BART station in San Francisco and proceeded to block traffic entering the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.

There was an early morning scuffle with police in front of the San Francisco Chronicle building at Fifth and Mission streets before the group divided and spread out to block the cars from entering the security zone for the conference.

By mid-morning, the group formed human blockades at Mission and Fifth streets, New Montgomery Street as well as other entrances, but officials re-routed eventgoers in and out of the conference using alternative access points.

"We came to block the entrances to the APEC CEO Summit, because we are opposed to APEC and the policies it's promoting," said Rhonda Ramiro with the No To APEC coalition. "We had people willing to put their bodies across the intersection, because we are against business as usual."

Other protesters include the Chinese religious movement Falun Gong, who lined Market Street with banners declaring their persecution from China. A pro-Chinese flag waving group gathered on Jessie and Third streets, blaring patriotic music.

## Demonstrators stood outside Austin high school with anti-LGBTQ, abortion messages

AUSTIN (KXAN) — As students were released from McCallum High School Tuesday afternoon, the district confirms roughly eight people stood outside with anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion signs.

“The protesters were on the sidewalk but were blocking the buses, so they were asked to move,” a spokesperson for AISD said. “Austin ISD Police officers were on-site to ensure everyone’s safety, and the protesters left after about an hour.”

KXAN does not share photos or videos of possible hate speech as standard practice, which is why we have not included photos in this story and blurred signs in the video above.

“Instead we need to be standing up and saying that everyone belongs, and this is a community for everyone,” said Council Member Alison Alter of District 10.

In July, Alter officially helped launch an anti-hate campaign called “We All Belong.” The program came about after a series of hate speech incidents and a hate crime in which Alter’s synagogue — Congregation Beth Israel — was lit on fire in 2021.

Alter said the goal is twofold: One, to make reporting a hate crime easier and two, to connect people with resources and support.

“{The We All Belong website} tells you when to call 911, when to use IReport,” Alter said. “Not every hate crime or hate incident is the same, but people do need to report.”

You can also partner with the city to host a pop-up event through the program. The city will provide materials and messaging for the event. You can apply to host an event here. Some funding is available.

“Take action in the form of having those hard community conversations or creating a space where people can come together and celebrate,” Alter said. She continued: “Fight hate with love, fight hate with light.”

The district said school counselors will be on standby for students at McCallum upset about the Tuesday incident....

## Over 150 people rally with PGSU to support next steps in union campaign

Over 150 people rally with the PGSU to support unionization efforts. Zehao Wu / The Daily Princetonian

Over 150 graduate students, undergraduates, and post-graduate fellows rallied together with Princeton Graduate Students United (PGSU) to demand fair wages and more affordable housing from the University. A flyer distributed for the event stated “power and protection for grad workers,” and promoted PGSU’s union card campaign, which makes organizing efforts an official union campaign.

The audience listened to speeches from graduate workers, Rutgers American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers (AAUP-AFT), Teachers and Reachers United (TRU) at Johns Hopkins University, and Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA). Undergraduate student groups including the Princeton College Democrats and the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) also went to the rally to show their support.

“Princeton works because we do,” members of PGSU stated during a speech.

The crowd chanted at one point during the rally, “accept my labor, respect my rights.” They also repeated the chant in Spanish. A number of attendees held signs, including those saying, “more pay, more say,” “I signed my union card,” and “union yes!”

After the rally, graduate students walked around different buildings on campus to hand out union cards. A member of PGSU collected cards on the first floor of the Frist Campus Center. By the time of publication, over 1,200 cards were filled out.

According to the flyer, the group demands fair and effective grievance procedures, improved international student support, better healthcare and funded childcare, affordable housing through graduation, guaranteed pay raises and contingency funds, and clear and safe work standards. PGSU also hopes that the rally and union cards will help them fight for legal recognition as a labor union so that they can represent graduate student workers and negotiate with the University to form a contra...

## Drag performers protest outside George Santos’ office

This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

NEW YORK (PIX11) – Drag performers led a protest outside embattled Republican Congressman George Santos’ district office over the weekend.

The demonstrators on Saturday condemned the openly gay lawmaker’s support of anti-LGBTQ legislation that would ban drag shows and his sponsorship of a bill to make the AR-15 the “national gun of the United States,” according to multiple published reports.

The protesters said it’s hypocritical of Santos – who has been accused of performing in drag in Brazil – to align himself with Republicans working to ban drag shows. Santos has denied reports that he competed in a drag queen beauty pageant in Brazil.

Organizers of the protest on Saturday said the event was also a celebration of the House Ethics Committee launching an investigation into several allegations against Santos, including alleged campaign finance violations and an accusation of sexual misconduct....

## Activists to rally at state Capitol to urge Gov. Whitmer to grant clemency to more inmates

click to enlarge Shutterstock Activists are calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to grant clemency to more inmates.

Hundreds of people are expected to gather at the U.S. Capitol on Saturday afternoon to call on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to grant clemency to more inmates languishing in prison.

And there’s a treat for those who participate: Everyone will receive a free serving of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream as part of the company’s national campaign to support clemency for people convicted of cannabis-related offenses.

Among those scheduled to speak at the rally are Michael Thompson, whom Gov. Gretchen Whitmer granted clemency in December 2020; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein; prison reform activist and U.S. Senate candidate Hill Harper; Wayne County Prosecutor Eli Savit; formerly incarcerated people; family members of those behind bars; and activists for criminal justice reform.

“There are a lot of good people still inside that need [Whitmer’s] help,” Thompson, who is now president of the Michael Thompson Clemency Project’s board, said in a statement.

Thompson served more than 25 years in prison after selling marijuana to an undercover cop.

Also scheduled to speak is Tina Talbot, who was previously incarcerated for killing her husband in what many say was an act of self-defense that saved her and her son’s life.

The rally will take place from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on the state Capitol lawn.

Activists are urging the governor to grant clemency to seniors who have served more than half their sentence, people with chronic illness, individuals with cannabis-related convictions, domestic violence victims, people sentenced to life without parole as juveniles, and those who were automatically tried for crimes committed as a youth.

While the jail and prison populations have been on the decline in Michigan, most of that reduction came during t...

## 1 year of war: Local efforts to remember lives lost in Ukraine

GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — Friday marks one year since Russia sent 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine. On this one-year reflection of the war, the West Michigan community pledges to continue helping the war-torn country with a candlelight vigil planned on Gillette Bridge in Downtown Grand Rapids.

Life in Ukraine continues to go on despite the war. Students go to class, people go to work and to restaurants. But it doesn't mean life has been easy.

Recent Stories from fox17online.com

"It's very heartbreaking. It really wears you down emotionally and physically," Grand Rapids resident Anna Kovalenko said.

Anna is from Cherkasy, a city in central Ukraine. She moved to the U.S. when she was 26-years-old with her husband Oleksander (Alex) Kovalenko. The rest of her family is still in Ukraine and she worries about her mom constantly.

"They still have air raid sirens every day throughout the day, several times, and she can hear us missiles flying over the city from time to time," Anna said.

Those sirens and that fear is what drove Anna to help the people of Ukraine over 5,000 miles away, in West Michigan.

She's been fundraising at local silent art auctions, collecting donations, raising thousands of dollars for those in the war-torn country. Because she says she can't sit back and do nothing.

"I just can't do otherwise," Anna said through tears.

Anna's husband Alex served 10 years as a naval officer in the United States Navy and is heartbroken by what he's seeing in his home country.

“It's a lot of pain and disbelief," he said.

Alex says he's proud of his wife and her efforts to help the people of Ukraine.

"It really warms my heart that she's able to do that," Alex said. "It gives her meaning and gives meaning to other people as well."

## Pro-life advocates march in downtown Tucson six months after Roe versus Wade overturned

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - Thousands of people stepped out in Tucson to show their support for the right to life.

The March for Life kicked off downtown on Saturday morning, ending four miles away at the Holy Hope Cemetery.

This march marked the first big gathering in Tucson since Roe v. Wade was overturned back in June.

Bob Pawson, a longtime pro-life advocate, said it was important for him to get out and show his support.

“You can believe it’s okay to kill babies. But once you kill a baby, you’re on the wrong side because you’ve done wrong.”

Pawson was joined by more than 1,200 people joined together in Tucson all marching for pro-life. But said there is still more work to be done.

“Our celebration of the ending of Roe is somewhat tempered by the fact that here in Arizona abortions continue. That 15-week nonsense. 95% if abortions happen by the 15th week. So, we are fooling ourselves thinking we are saving a lot of babies.”

March for Life Organizer Kelly Copeland also joined the crowds in Tucson. He said said he took on the task of organizing the march all by himself. He said it is the “least he could do” when many women fight to have a baby everyday.

“To do a little inconvenience to put together this event is nothing compared to what women go through, the struggle that they go through to have a baby.”

He added that this year’s march felt more important than the last 50 years saying pro-life advocates still “need to come out here and change hearts.”

Right now, in Arizona, women can seek abortions up to 15-weeks. This comes after an appeals court ruled an old territorial law could not be enforced allowing the 15-week ban to take effect.

## Protesters call for arrest of white woman who fatally shot Black neighbor in front of kids

OCALA, Fla. (AP) — Authorities came under pressure Tuesday to arrest and charge a white woman who fired through her front her door and killed a Black neighbor in a case that has put Florida’s divisive stand your ground law back into the spotlight.

About three dozen mostly Black protesters gathered outside the Marion County Judicial Center to demand that the shooter be arrested in the country’s latest flashpoint over race and gun violence. The chief prosecutor, State Attorney William Gladson, met with the protesters and urged patience while the investigation continues.

“If we are going to make a case we need as much time and as much evidence as possible,” Gladson said. “I don’t want to compromise any criminal investigation and I’m not going to do that.”

Ajike Owens, a 35-year-old mother of four, was killed in the Friday night shooting that Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said was the culmination of a 2½-year feud between neighbors. The women lived in the rolling hills south of Ocala, a north Florida city that is the heart of the state’s horse country.

Woods said Monday detectives are working with the State Attorney’s Office and must investigate possible self-defense claims before they can move forward with any possible criminal charges. The sheriff pointed out that because of the stand your ground law he can’t legally make an arrest unless he can prove the shooter did not act in self-defense.

On Tuesday, a stuffed teddy bear and bouquets marked the area near where Owens was shot. Nearby, children were riding bikes and scooters, and playing basketball. Protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “A.J. A.J. A.J” using Owens’ nickname. They carried signs saying: “Say her name Ajike Owens” and “It’s about us.”

Outside, the Rev. Bernard Tuggerson said the Black community in Ocala has suffered injustices for years. “Marion County is suffering and needs to be healed completely,” he said. “If we don’t turn from our wicked ways of the world, it’s going to be an ongo...

## Portland clears Harbor View encampment despite protest

﻿

City workers cleared Portland’s largest homeless encampment early Tuesday morning despite an attempt by advocates, faith leaders and other protesters to stop the sweep by forming a human chain.

Standing at the edge of Harbor View Memorial Park, Matt Brown of Hope Squad Maine checked in with people living in the tents as other volunteers handed out hot chocolate.

During past sweeps, Brown has helped people move their belongings to another camp, but there are no other encampments to go to now, he said, noting that some of the people he works with have been through five or six sweeps.

“At this point, I think people are resigned to the fact that the city’s not providing them much of a real choice. So they’re frustrated. But it’s freezing cold and I think a lot of them realize that (the shelter) might be the only viable option at this point,” he said. “I can’t imagine how exhausting it is to continually go through this.”

Portland has sought to clear the camp at Harbor View for weeks, ever since a large number of beds opened up at the Homeless Services Center in Riverside after asylum seekers were moved to a new shelter. The city originally planned to dismantle the encampment on Dec. 19 but that was pushed back after the City Council passed a resolution seeking a delay. Then the sweep planned for Dec. 28 was postponed because of rain.

The city counted 70 tents at the park Tuesday morning, but about a third of them appeared to be empty, spokesperson Jessica Grondin said. Outreach workers from the city and social services agencies were on hand to talk with people about their options and help them move to the shelter, where 86 beds were open – 57 for men and 29 for women.

As of Tuesday night, staff at the city’s Homeless Services Center on Riverside Street had completed intakes and assigned beds to 17 people from the Harbor View encampment, Grondin said. That left 51 beds available to people seeking shelter, including 26 beds for women and 25 for men,...

## San Francisco Lawmakers To Protest Ban on Homeless Sweeps

The injunction, requested by the Coalition on Homelessness as part of an ongoing lawsuit, temporarily restricts city workers from removing encampments, except in narrow circumstances such as for street cleaning. It has also inflamed frustrations among residents who feel they have little recourse in addressing troublesome encampments, even in situations that become dangerous.

On Aug. 23, a Ninth Circuit panel will hear arguments in the city’s appeal of the controversial injunction, which was handed down by U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu in December 2022 . The hearing will take place during a 9:30 a.m. session at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at 95 Seventh St.

Supervisors Matt Dorsey, Rafael Mandelman and Joel Engardio are expected to attend the rally alongside San Francisco residents who are upset with street conditions that they say have grown increasingly untenable.

A group of San Francisco lawmakers, residents and merchants are heading up a rally outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals next week, just ahead of a key hearing on an injunction that temporarily bars the city from enforcing laws against sitting and lodging on the street.

“There’s this huge disparity between how they’re talking publicly about their interpretation of the lawsuit and how the city attorney actually interpreted it,” Friedenbach said. “It’s delusional to think that the city is going to change what they’re doing without asserting pressure.”

Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said she hasn’t seen much of a change in the city’s enforcement of encampments and believes the rally’s organizers are missing the point of the injunction.

As a result of the injunction, city workers are walking a fine line in responding to encampments. The city may not enforce specific ordinances around sitting, lying or lodging on the street; however, workers can ask people occupying encampments to temporarily relocate for street cleaning and enforce health codes an...

## Rhode Island Teamsters Enter Second Week on the Picket Line at Northeast Transportation Services

Unfair Labor Practice Strike Continues for Logistics Drivers in Pawtucket

(PAWTUCKET, R.I.) – Today marks a full week on the picket line for more than 60 drivers employed by Northeast Transportation Services in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Workers are currently picketing 24 hours a day at the facility to demand wages high enough to keep pace with the cost of living, as well as affordable healthcare and retirement benefits.

“This company doesn’t care about us. We are overworked and underpaid. Now, they are bringing outside scab labor and paying them more than we make. They can afford to treat us better. Our health care is too high, and our wages are too low. We are standing up for ourselves to let this company know that we deserve better,” said Jerry Porter, a driver for Northeast Transportation Services and member of Local 251.

On June 22, Local 251 members went on strike in response to unfair labor practices by the company. In addition to wages and health care, workers at Northeast Transportation Services are also fighting for retirement benefits and safety improvements, noting that equipment and vehicles at the facility are unsafe and dangerous, putting both workers and the general public at risk.

“Workers are fed up with this company. They know they deserve better, and they decided to do something about it. Our members are committed to staying on strike until Northeast Transportation ends its pattern of anti-worker, anti-union behavior and negotiates a fair contract that provides workers with proper wages, benefits and standards,” said Matt Taibi, International Vice President and Local 251 Secretary-Treasurer.

## Oakland teachers union authorizes strike, plans rally Wednesday

Teachers at the Oakland Educators Association office said they plan to rally outside the OUSD board meeting Wednesday, one day after the union announced the members had voted to authorize a strike if labor contract talks don't progress.

"My big concern is that we'll have to go on strike next week because our district won't come to the table and bargain in good faith. They've had six months to settle this contract," said Carrie Anderson, an Oakland second-grade teacher.

"Eighty-seven percent of our members participated in our strike election, and 88% of those voted ‘yes’ to authorize a strike," said Ishmael Armendariz, interim president of the Oakland Education Association.

The teachers union says they want more school safety and a living wage that goes beyond the district's proposed 3.5% raise over two years.

"California state mediators have reached out in attempts to support us in reaching an agreement," said Vilma Serrano, co-chair of the OEA Bargaining Team. OEA has accepted that support. Now it's up to OUSD."

Last Thursday, the district requested "injunctive relief", asking the Public Employment Relations Board to prohibit a strike. But that request was denied by the Public Employment Relations Board, which means a strike can move forward, the teachers union said.

Oakland School Board President Mike Hutchinson says the district is still actively negotiating in good faith.

Featured article

He says the latest offer includes a 3.5% pay raise and retention bonus incentives of $5,000-$10,000 to teachers with seniority over three years. He says it would also shorten the timeline for teachers to reach the maximum pay scale to 19 years from the current 32 years.

"That offer would bring most teachers in Oakland an 18-22% raise from numbers I've seen," Hutchinson said. "If this offer for compensation was accepted, it would put our teachers above [the] median in Alameda County, which would be a historic step for us."

Hutchinson says OUSD has a difficult budget ba...

## Pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian protesters kick off dueling demonstrations in Miami Beach

MIAMI BEACH — As the war in the Middle East intensifies, tensions here in South Florida have increased.

Separate demonstrations kicked off at Lummus Park in Miami Beach on Saturday afternoon, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters have gathered to voice their opinions and concerns as the world enters the sixth week since the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

On the Israeli side of Ocean Drive, demonstrators carried with them Israel's flag, photos of those kidnapped by Hamas and signs; and just across the street, pro-Palestinian demonstrators stood with signs and flags of Palestine flew.

A large presence of Miami Beach Police officers arrived promptly in response to the conflicting demonstrations to make sure that neither side got violent and disrupted the peace.

Pro-Israeli

On the pro-Israeli side, this was an emergency call.

Normally, these don't happen on Shabbat because it's the day of rest for the Jewish people; but, they said they thought it was important enough to get as many people as possible to come out here.

Some even asked rabbis for permission to break Shabbat.

"They always try to make it on Saturday, which is the holy day for Jewish people," said Amir Tal.

Tal grew up in Israel but now lives close enough to South Beach that he said he didn't have to drive to come out and support Israel.

"That mask that they put on, that's anti-Zionism and they care about this cause it's fake," he said. "Because Palestinians are dying in Syria, Palestinians are dying in Lebanon, in Jordan — everywhere — and they don't care about that. They only care about when it's Israel."

Throughout the afternoon, there were heated exchanges. Eventually, both crowds took opposite sides of Ocean Drive.

"They're talking about Israel committing genocide — they're the ones who committed genocide," said Haskel Meyer. "They slaughtered babies, they raped women, took Holocaust survivors."

Rynor witnessed one moment when three pro-Palestinian women asked for proof th...

## Las Vegas Casino Workers to Block Strip for Planned Rally

Las Vegas casino workers are still attempting to get better pay, benefits, and working conditions in ongoing contract negotiations. To force the hands of their employers, they have planned a rally that will block traffic on the Las Vegas Strip for around four hours this week.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed the planned rally will go ahead on Wednesday between 4pm and 8pm. In an X post, officials warned people to “expect delays & road closures between Flamingo and Paris Drive:”

The Culinary Workers Union – which represents 40,000 casino workers in Las Vegas – is currently negotiating with MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts for better contracts. Around 95% of the trade union’s members approved strike action last month, meaning casino employees could down tools at any point.

picketed casinos for the first time in more than two decades

Workers recently picketed casinos for the first time in more than two decades citing “very disappointing” negotiations with casino operators. Eight casinos faced disruption as a result, including the Bellagio Hotel & Casino, the MGM Grand, and Caesars Palace.

A similar situation is evolving in Detroit where casino workers also approved strike action. Around 3,700 workers began picketing MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Hollywood Casino at Greektown last week. The Detroit City Council has just voted for a resolution stating its support for the striking employees....

## Trump compares himself to Mandela and rails against Biden after filing for NH primary

In New Hampshire Monday, former president Donald Trump compared himself to anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela as he cast himself as the victim of federal and state prosecutors he alleges are targeting him and his businesses for political reasons.

Returning to the Granite State to register for its presidential primary, Trump held a rally where he railed against President Joe Biden's response to the Hamas attack on Israel and vowed to build an Iron Dome-style missile defense shield over the U.S.

Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.

But he focused much of his dark and at times profane speech on the criminal and civil cases against him, at one point suggesting he would go to prison like the former South African president who spent 27 years in prison for opposing South Africa’s apartheid system and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.

"I don't mind being Nelson Mandela because I'm doing it for a reason," Trump told am amped-up crowd of supporters at a sports complex in Derry, New Hampshire. "We've got to save our country from these fascists, these lunatics that we're dealing with. They're horrible people and they're destroying our country."

Trump is facing four criminal indictments as well as civil trials that span allegations that he inflated his worth, misclassified hush money payments to women during his 2016 campaign, illegally tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club.

The comments came after Trump formally filed for the first-in-the-nation primary, becoming the first person who has served as president to do so in person more than once.

"Vote for Trump and solve your problems," he wrote on the commemorative poster at the statehouse in Concord that all the candidates are asked to sign.

Candidates this year have until Oct. 27 to officially sign up, and dozens are expected to do so. The process is easy: They only n...

## WATCH: Catholic group demands more transparency with Alex Crow investigation

MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — Protestors lined up outside of Cathedral Square Sunday morning demanding more transparency and answers from the Archdiocese of Mobile regarding disgraced priest Alex Crow, who went to Italy with an 18-year-old recent McGill-Toolen graduate.

The group of protestors called the Catholic Warrior Initiative went to Cathedral Square; holding up signs calling out the alleged actions of Father Alex Crow.

“Whenever an incident happens, whether it be evil, whether it be whatever, if they acknowledged it, if they told the parishioners about it, just be open, honest and transparent about it,” Bud Hadley, organizer of the group, said.

The Mobile County Sheriff’s Office and Mobile County District Attorney’s Office launched their investigation after the Archdiocese of Mobile reported his behavior to them. MCSO previously stated that they’re may be evidence of Crow being involved with the recent graduate before she turned 18.

Concerns from the protestors rose as little information has been released about the investigation causing them to have mistrust of McGill-Toolen High School and the Catholic Church.

“The parents should not have should not have to worry about sending their kids to a Catholic school and worry about their children being sexually abused or emotionally abused,” Hadley said.

Other protestors said they’ve tried to report previous behavior that they’ve noticed to the Archdiocese, but they say nothing has been done about it.

“Even though when we present evidence to the archdiocese, they ignore it,” fellow protestor Debbie Cooper said. “Whether it’s actual pictures, actual emails, text, whatever it is, they ignore it and they claim that they there was no knowledge of it occurring. They would have acted on it and they don’t.”

“So the Crowe situation, at least as far as him taking her to Italy, it could have absolutely been prevented,” Hadley said. “Parents and students have complained about Crow for years, but yet he was still allowed to. No...

## Flooded-out Oakland tenants protest landlord's delayed repairs

OAKLAND -- The effects of the severe winter storms are still being felt. In east Oakland, some tenants are still living in hotels after they were flooded out of their apartments on New Year's Eve.

Sunday morning, fed-up tenants protested in front of their landlord Michael Johnson's Oakland home.

"We are here because he still has a bedroom he sleeps in. He still has his own bathroom. He still has all of his stuff," said tenant Dream Jasmine Braggs.

About 25 people chanted "Housing is a human right" and "No more business for Michael Johnson."

"He came out through his window just to record and see but he didn't come out to even acknowledge that we are his tenants that are still displaced till this day," said tenant and single mom Faviola Abendano.

She and her two daughters joined the rally.

"We are no longer going to be silenced and we need answers now," Abendano said.

Johnson is the founder of UrbanCore Development, which owns the complex known as Coliseum Connections. It is located next to the Coliseum BART station. It opened in 2019 with 110 units. Half of the units are leased at market rate and the other units are affordable housing.

On Dec. 31, 2022, a severe storm flooded the garage and knocked out the electrical system at the complex. FEMA stepped in to pay for hotels after UrbanCore said it ran out of money.

"I don't have a home that I can go back to and just relax and do my homework and my grades have went down really bad," said Abendano's 11-year-old daughter Sureneity Mendez.

Mendez said their hotel room is about 300 square feet. She and her 9-year-old sister miss their 1,200-square-foot town home.

"It's hard because we can't have our own space," Mendez said.

There's no kitchen and no microwave in the room. They said every day the meals are either fast food take-out or at sit-down restaurants.

"I feel overwhelming 'cause I can't be a kid," said 9-year-old Sapphire Mendez.

The tenants said they just want to go home.

## Loyola New Orleans students protest for embattled Black professor

Loyola University New Orleans (LOYNO) has come under fire this month with an open letter protesting the firing of a popular professor who directs the school’s Africana studies department.

First reported by Philip Lewis of HuffPost, the 3-page document—shared on April 13 and endorsed by more than 600 students, faculty, alumni, and parents—preceded a walkout and public demonstration on the front lawn of campus on Wednesday.

Dr. Scott Heath, who has taught at the school on the tenure track since 2019, was informed in October that his contract would not be renewed following the end of the spring semester. The news came shortly after his return from a leave of absence related to the death of a close friend.

Many students received the news more recently, upon realizing his courses were no longer available for the Fall 2023 semester.

“Despite Professor Heath being on his second year of tenure track at Loyola University, informing the English department of his friend’s passing and his own brief absence, and keeping his students up to date, the English department continues to push forward with his termination during this period of grief,” the students’ open letter reads.

“There is a clear lack of support and empathy held for a vulnerable professor, violating the Jesuit principles of Cura Personalis and Cura Apostolica, or the ‘care of the whole person.’”

LOYNO, whose student population is roughly one-fifth Black, has had a Black studies program since the 1990s but currently has few professors who teach in it consistently, according to students. Heath is one of only two Black faculty in the school’s English department, and the only full-time member who is Black.

Heath’s supporters say he is held in “high regard” and a group of his students have noted that his leave of absence did not disrupt his teaching performance. The university attributed his firing to “absenteeism” and “negligence.”

According to the university’s website, Heath’s academic specialties include “Afri...

## Kew Gardens Hills Turns Out In Support Of Israel

On October 9, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, other elected officials, and Jewish leaders hosted a vigil honoring the terror attack victims in Israel. The vigil was held outside the Queens Public Library at Kew Gardens Hills (72-33 Vleigh Place). The event was held to honor the hundreds of innocent victims killed over the weekend and to call for lasting peace in the region.

Prior to the vigil, the Borough President said, “The images out of Israel this weekend are horrific beyond words. There is absolutely no justification for the brutality on display against innocent Israeli families, and Queens unequivocally condemns Hamas’ vicious invasion. Our thoughts are with all those mourning the loss of a loved one or fearing for the future of their family, both in Israel and here in Queens. This savage violence must end immediately for the sake of the safety of innocent families on either side of the Israel-Palestine border.”

Cosponsors of the event included the Jewish Community Relations Council and Queens Jewish Community Council. Many elected officials attended, including Congressmembers Gregory Meeks and Grace Meng, State Senators Leroy Comrie, John Liu, and Toby Ann Stavisky, Assemblymembers Sam Berger, Andrew Hevesi, Nily Rozic, and David Weprin, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Councilmembers Selvena Brooks-Powers, Jim Gennaro, Linda Lee, Lynn Schulman, and Sandra Ung.

Congressman Meeks, who is also the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We will stand with Israel as it defends its people and long term security.”

## Rally held asking for answers in shooting death at Shively Animal clinic

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A rally was held on Sunday in honor of a man who was shot and killed at Shively Animal Clinic earlier this month.

Trent "TJ" Taylor Jr. was shot during some kind of argument at the clinic and died shortly thereafter at University of Louisville Hospital on May 14. Shively Police said the clinic was "extremely busy" that night when the shooting took place. There were more than 20 witnesses to interview.

People gathered at Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville demanding justice for Taylor.

In an interview with WDRB News, the victim's father Trent Taylor said his son was protecting coworkers from an aggressive client. He said his son's death is a clear case of murder, but so far no arrests have been made.

"Here we are two weeks out, two weeks out and we don't have a charge, not one charge," said Trent Taylor. "The reality of the situation is that a lady and her friends premeditatedly thought about going to Shively Animal Clinic, they knew what they were there to do, she had a gun on her and she was ready for the worst. She was prepared for it to go all the way. Why else would you bring a gun to settle a vet dispute?"

The case is now being reviewed by the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office.

A GoFundMe account has been created to help the Taylor family with funeral expenses and other costs. More than $46,000 has been donated.

Anyone with any information about what happened is asked to call 502-930-2SPD.

## Hundreds march to support Peninsula teachers amid labor negotiations

The signs said it all:

“More than praise, we need a raise.”

“Platitudes do not pay the bills.”

“You can’t put students first if you put teachers last.”

Peninsula teachers and their supporters, carrying those signs, once again rallied to voice their displeasure on the current status of labor negotiations this week, this time making the short trek from historic Malaga Cove Plaza to the local school district offices.

Pay and other issues have led to an impasse between the teacher’s union and the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. The two sides have been negotiating salary and benefits since July 2021. While the existing contract is set to expire on June 30, a third mediation meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, May 30.

Interim Superintendent Doug Kimberly, who replaced former district leader Alex Cherniss in early May, could not be reached for comment this week. But Kimberly’s predecessor had previously said he hopes for a fair and fiscally responsible settlement, though Cherniss had also added that pension and benefit costs posed a “huge budgetary challenge” when trying to raising teacher salaries.

Still, the contract remains elusive.

That’s why teachers and their backers lined both sides the street in front of Malaga Cove Plaza, in Palos Verdes Estates, earlier this week. Cars passing by honked their horns in support.

The ralliers then marched to the district offices ahead of the Wednesday, May 24, Board of Education meeting. When they arrived, Tim Coleman, president of the Palos Verdes Faculty Association, spoke to the crowd, which numbered more than 200 people.

“We’re fed up,” he said. “We’re done.”

In past interviews, Coleman said the hope is the PVFA and district will be able to avoid a strike.

“All we are asking of you is that you put our needs on your to-do list,” Coleman said at Wednesday’s board meeting. “This board did not create this mess, but you do help to solve it.”

## Anti-abortion group to rally, even as Arkansas’s maternal mortality and teen motherhood rates soar

Arkansas Right to Life

“Help keep Arkansas abortion-free!” That’s the bright red text at the top of a flyer announcing the 46th Annual March for Life, described by organizers as “a peaceful and prayerful event that attracts thousands of Arkansans from across the state including churches and families to remember the estimated 60-plus million unborn children killed by legal abortion.”

Organized by a group called Arkansas Right to Life, the march takes place on Sunday, Jan. 21, beginning at 1:30 p.m. at Capitol Avenue and State Street and proceeding to the state Capitol.

Advertisement

The march’s date is meant to mark the 51st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision on January 22, 1973, which legalized the right to abortion at a federal level. That 50-year precedent was overturned in 2022 with the Dobbs decision, which took away the constitutional right to abortion, after which Arkansas swiftly prohibited it at the state level. “Even with the overturning of that tragic court decision,” Arkansas Right to Life’s director Rose Mimms said, “our work to defend and protect pregnant mothers and their unborn children is as fierce as ever.”

Meanwhile, pregnant mothers in Arkansas are some of the most imperiled people in the state, watchdog group On AR Watch says, and there’s a direct line between the state’s regressive reproductive rights policies and its maternal mortality rates, in which Arkansas also ranks at the top of the charts. Responding to a ranking by a partisan group called LifeNews that named Arkansas as the most “pro-life” state in the U.S., On AR Watch said:

Advertisement

A main takeaway to remember is that lack of access to abortion is correlated with high maternal mortality. This is largely because doctors flee in droves from states that tell them how they can and cannot practice medicine. It’s settled medical practice that abortions are medically necessary for treating complications like placental abruption, bleeding from placenta previa, preecl...

## Save Ohio Parks’ allies rally to fight against fracking

LORE CITY, Ohio — Environmental agencies across Ohio rallied Saturday at Salt Fork State Park to protest fracking under Ohio state parks forests, wildlife areas and other public lands.

Salt Fork is the first park on the Ohio Department of Natural Resources list to be fracked by natural gas and oil developers.

About 65 people from Save Ohio Parks, the Ohio Environmental Council, Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Council, Third Act, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Leave No Child Inside and Sierra Club Ohio picnicked and rallied against the new Ohio law that requires fracking under state parks and public lands.

Save Ohio Parks is a new nonprofit made up of volunteers from across the state. Speakers touched on fracking’s effects on animals, plants and soils; methane and toxic chemical effects on human health; and how fracking could impact Ohio state parks’ freshwater lakes, streams and creeks.

Randi Pokladnik, Ph.D., a research chemist and ecologist from Urichsville, said fracking Ohio’s state parks and public lands will destroy natural habitats, reduce native plants and animals and irretrievably alter the face of Ohio’s taxpayer-supported and protected natural places.

“The mixed mesophytic forests that make up Salt Fork State Park and many of the other state lands in southeast Ohio are second only to the Amazon rainforest for diversity,” she said. “Fracking on or near these lands will permanently alter the land and aquatic ecosystems and negatively affect the species which depend on them. Fracking is not compatible with a healthy forest ecosystem.”

An unnamed oil and gas company has applied to frack 281 parcels with 16 well pads surrounding Salt Fork’s 20,000-acre park at distances as close as 400 feet from park borders.

Well pads can sit on 5- to 10-acre plots of land clear cut of trees. The pads are paved with cement, with a fracking rig around 120 feet tall installed on the pad.

Typically, 4 million to 10 million gallons of fresh water are taken from local lakes...

## Castleton students rally to protest proposed cuts in state university’s programs, faculty

CASTLETON — Nearly a hundred people participated in a student-led rally at the Vermont State University’s Castleton campus on Thursday afternoon, protesting proposed cuts in programs and faculty jobs.

The university system has been seeking to trim spending after posting a $22 million deficit last fiscal year.

The rally participants, including a marching band, gathered outside a campus building where several state legislators were meeting with union representatives for the university’s faculty and staff. The legislators streamed out of the building to see the protesters.

“Cuts are in the wrong place,” one participant yelled.

“Admin is bloated,” a couple of people said.

“There are jobs in the arts,” the group chanted.

They were alluding to the recommendation of VTSU Interim President Mike Smith to eliminate 10 degree programs starting in the fall of 2024, affecting music; performance, arts and technology; and photography, among others.

He said those programs currently enroll 77 students, less than 2% of the student body.

Smith’s draft proposal also identified 13 degree programs that should be consolidated with others, many of which appear to be similar. For example, the university could merge a program in architectural and building engineering technology with one in architectural engineering technology. A degree in health promotion could also be folded into a health science degree, or be discontinued.

The program cuts and consolidations would eliminate 20 to 33 full-time faculty jobs — between 1...

Postal workers hold rally to raise awareness about daily dangers they face in Metro Detroit

DETROIT – United States Postal Service workers held an “Enough is Enough” rally to raise awareness about the daily dangers they face while delivering mail in Metro Detroit.

The rally was held in Downtown Detroit on Monday (Nov. 6).

Southfield letter carrier Matt McBee recounted the day he was robbed at gunpoint while on his route.

“All I did was turn to the left for two seconds to get my mail and to get ready, and I heard a noise,” said McBee. “The next thing I know I looked up and there was a gun touching my head.”

The robbery of McBee occurred last July, but he told Local 4 it happened multiple times since.

His story, along with countless others, was why the United States Postal Service (USPS) gathered in Detroit and across the country.

Since 2020, armed robberies and violent attacks against postal workers have increased at a rate of roughly 30% year to year. That means more than 2,000 letter carriers have experienced a trauma we learned about firsthand on Monday.

“I never thought that it would happen to me,” said Tran Do. “I can’t breathe when I think about it.”

Do was the latest letter carrier to come face to face with armed robbers two weeks ago in Northville.

“Two of them walked up with the gun pointed at my stomach while they were asking for the equipment,” Do said. “I never think it happen in Northville because to me, Northville is very safe.”

“I can still feel the gun touching my head,” McBee said. “I turned around and saw an AK.”

McBee said he thinks about that day ...

## RISD students plead not guilty to recent pro-Palestine vandalism in Providence

RISD students plead not guilty to recent pro-Palestine vandalism in Providence

Maggie Weng and Finch Bryant are arraigned in Providence District Court for recent Pro-Palestine vandalism, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023. (WLNE)

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WLNE) — Two Rhode Island School of Design students were arraigned Thursday in connection to vandalism at the Textron building in Providence.

Maggie Weng and Finch Bryant, both 19, pled not guilty in Providence District Court.

They were both held on $1,000 personal recognizance.

Providence police said the Textron building was vandalized twice this week.

The RISD students were arrested for allegedly having a part in the most recent vandalism incident, which happened Wednesday morning. Chief Oscar Perez said the Textron building was defaced with “Free Gaza” and “Kills Kids” written in red paint.

The incidents are among a string of pro-Palestine messages left on buildings in Providence.

Police are still looking for those responsible after Farm Fresh Rhode Island was hit with “Free Palestine” written in blue spray paint two weeks ago.

Red paint drips also remained on the door to the Rhode Island School of Design store on North Main Street on Monday night. It appeared someone had written messages, but they were wiped off.

ABC 6 News obtained the following statement from RISD:

“RISD is deeply committed to providing a safe and supportive campus environment for our students and we do not tolerate unlawful behavior of any kind, on- or off-campus. Providence police is handling this situation and can best speak to the specifics of their investigation.”

Weng and Bryant are both expected back in court on Nov. 15....

## Screenwriters, actors to rally at Hawaii State Capitol amid historic Hollywood strike

HONOLULU (KHON2) – Local screenwriters and actors plan to rally at the Hawaii State Capitol in solidarity with fellow members of the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.

For the first time in 63 years, more than 180,000 WGA and SAG-AFTRA members are striking.

The two unions could not agree with film studios and streaming services on fair pay and concerns around Artificial Intelligence rights.

Aaron Kandell, a screenwriter for the 2016 film Moana, said a common misconception regarding Hollywood writers and actors is that they make a ton of money, but that’s only the case if you’re considered “A-List.”

“Most of the majority of those 180,000 members that are on strike are day workers. People who get paid daily or weekly rates and who have to chase gigs,” said Kandell.

“The average writer in Hollywood, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, makes $69,000 a year,” Kandell added. “If you put that in perspective, Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, gets paid $74,000 a day. So he’s making more in a day than most writers make in a year. That’s why we’re striking.”

The rally will be held on Tuesday, July 18, from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Hawaii State Capitol on South Beretania Street.

Local members from both unions will give speeches and wave signs.

## Advocates rally for affordable housing outside Cincinnati City Hall

CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Dozens of people rallied Wednesday for a housing issue to be put on the November ballot in Cincinnati.

Cincinnati Action for Housing Now is leading the charge, and they say they have more than enough signatures to get the issue on the ballot.

The group was outside City Hall calling for change to address what they call Cincinnati’s affordable housing crisis.

They also spoke in front of Cincinnati City Council.

“Housing is a human right,” declared local pastor Tyler Moquin-Lee. “We have a big issue in Cincinnati right now with people without a place to live, and you know, a society does better if everybody has a place to live. Crime rates decrease, economic activity increases, and it’s also just a way that we can care for our neighbors. It’s really really important.”

No word yet on what city leaders think of the petition or whether council members will vote to add it to the ballot.

## Bigger Than Roe

We showed up and marched in the 1970s, and on the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade we're still marching for our right to choice for our own bodies. For our rally on January 22, WEAR YOUR FINEST '70S ATTIRE to show the nation that we've fought this fight before, and we'll keep fighting until we secure our rights to healthcare and bodily autonomy! OR come dressed in SCRUBS to say Abortion Is Healthcare! Women's lives are on the line if we lose the right to choose what we do with our bodies!

Follow our instagram @womensmarch.bos for live updates and information! You can also donate to our march efforts here: https://www.gofundme.com/f/womens-march-boston

If you'd like to share your personal abortion story please click here: https://forms.gle/CvikeKFcmUnuAS2T9

We are ALL born free and equal in dignity and rights. The Supreme Court of the U.S. and the United States Congress have failed in their obligation to protect, respect, and uphold our human rights. The women's wave delivered a blow to anti-freedom politicians in the 2022 midterms, and now we are taking the fight out of D.C. and into every single state in this country.

On January 22, 2023, the anniversary of Roe V Wade, as we mourn the loss of nearly 50 years of constitutional protections, we send another clear message:

The midterms were just the beginning. We are not going gently. We are taking our fight to every state house and every state legislator in this country. We are putting all politicians at every level of government on notice: If you come for our families, our freedoms, or our future, we are coming for your seat. Our movement is strong. Our movement is growing.

Our movement is Bigger than Roe....

## Student-led Protest Over Administration’s Response to Recent Racially Motivated Harassment – The Megaphone

A stream of students, staff, and faculty, many dressed in black, gradually made their way from the Bishop’s Lounge to the Academic Mall, carrying signs and chanting: “No more Mark Twain. We want change!”

Last week, on February 23rd, during SU’s annual Brown Symposium, focused on Art and Politics and named “Radical Imagination,” there was a student-organized protest over what many students are calling the administration’s inadequate response to recent racist incidents, from the noose found in Ruter, to the anti-Semitic notes last semester, to the racial slurs written in Clark last week.

The response from the administration was to send emails informing students of actions taken by the President that, as Black Student Union (BSU) member Kellie Henderson put it, are “sugar-coating the racial terrorism against Students of color” and that “do not address the issues or soothe the anger and sadness of those affected.”

The event began with a choir, led by student vocalist Daniela Echevarria, singing in the Bishop’s Lounge. Students were then led to the Academic Mall, where speeches were given by the event organizers, including Rachel Thompson, Kellie Henderson, Taylor Bass, Raven Waugh, and Brianna Westmoreland.

Rachel Thompson expressed frustration over the administration’s lack of intervention in the issues on campus. The JEDI center’s workshops, trainings, and seminars can only do so much. Raven Waugh said: “We call on the university administration to take swift and decisive action to address racism on campus.”

Rachel directly addressed the administration, urging them that when they do look for solutions, they should: “Ask professionals who are trained in DIBE (Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity) initiatives. Do not assume what students of color need or want without asking them or asking your DIBE professionals.”

The mic then opened up to let SU students speak about how they felt about...

## West Mesa students rally against gun violence

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – West Mesa students held a rally on the campus, calling for changes as gun violence continues to plague the community. The movement comes after a deadly shooting last year that happened just outside the school campus. It claimed the life of one student.

On Saturday, dozens of community members attended the event while students rallied by speaking out and reading poems they had written.

One student read her poem, “I’m tired of not being cared for. I want to be important. I’m tired of not having a voice. I want to be heard. I’m tired of simply being watched. I want to be seen.”

Students behind the rally said that they hope it will unite the Mustang community and start a motion of change in their hallways.

“We shouldn’t be afraid to go in to school and stuff like that, and to really show our community that it’s not safe to, for people to have guns with them. And it’s not safe to be scared to go to school because of other people for other people’s consequences,” said Diego Alcla, a junior at West Mesa High School.

Al Burson, the father of Andrew Burson who was shot and killed by another West Mesa student in February 2022, spoke on Saturday. He said no family wins in this situation, victim or assailant.

“I just want to get this point across the pain is immeasurable. You can never recover from this, so tell people to think before they do anything.”

Students also organized a march around campus with community members chanting for change. They also walked passed the site where Burson was killed and held a moment of silence for him.

In other speeches that were given, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said the District Attorney’s Office is fighting for strong penalties in the court for offenders. Bregman also asked community members to band together and educate everyone, including kids, on the dangers of guns in school.

“That is critically important, so it’s not just the punishment part about it. It’s also making sure we [are] ...
